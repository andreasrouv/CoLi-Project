Now after \"Let-us-bolt\" say \"at-top-speed!\"\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. \"At-top-speed!\"\\n\\nNICIAS. Splendid! Just as if you were masturbating yourself; first\\nslowly, \"Let-us-bolt\"; then quick and firmly, \"at-top-speed!\"\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Let-us-bolt, let-us-bolt-at-top-speed![9]\\n\\nNICIAS. Hah! does that not please you?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. I\\' faith, yes! yet I fear me your omen bodes no good to my\\nhide.\\n\\nNICIAS. How so?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Because hard rubbing abrades the skin when folk masturbate\\nthemselves.\\n\\nNICIAS. The best thing we can do for the moment is to throw ourselves at\\nthe feet of the statue of some god.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Of which statue? Any statue? Do you then believe there are\\ngods?\\n\\nNICIAS. Certainly.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. What proof have you?\\n\\nNICIAS. The proof that they have taken a grudge against me. Is that not\\nenough?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. I\\'m convinced it is. But to pass on. Do you consent to my\\ntelling the spectators of our troubles?\\n\\nNICIAS. \\'Twould not be amiss, and we might ask them to show us by their\\nmanner, whether our facts and actions are to their liking.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. I will begin then. We have a very brutal master, a perfect\\nglutton for beans,[10] and most bad-tempered; \\'tis Demos of the Pnyx,[11]\\nan intolerable old man and half deaf. The beginning of last month he\\nbought a slave, a Paphlagonian tanner, an arrant rogue, the incarnation\\nof calumny. This man of leather knows his old master thoroughly; he plays\\nthe fawning cur, flatters, cajoles; wheedles, and dupes him at will with\\nlittle scraps of leavings, which he allows him to get. \"Dear Demos,\" he\\nwill say, \"try a single case and you will have done enough; then take\\nyour bath, eat, swallow and devour; here are three obols.\"[12] Then the\\nPaphlagonian filches from one of us what we have prepared and makes a\\npresent of it to our old man. T\\'other day I had just kneaded a Spartan\\ncake at Pylos;[13] the cunning rogue came behind my back, sneaked it and\\noffered the cake, which was my invention, in his own name. He keeps us at\\na distance and suffers none but himself to wait upon the master; when\\nDemos is dining, he keeps close to his side with a thong in his hand and\\nputs the orators to flight. He keeps singing oracles to him, so that the\\nold man now thinks of nothing but the Sibyl. Then, when he sees him\\nthoroughly obfuscated, he uses all his cunning and piles up lies and\\ncalumnies against the household; then we are scourged and the\\nPaphlagonian runs about among the slaves to demand contributions with\\nthreats and gathers \\'em in with both hands. He will say, \"You see how I\\nhave had Hylas beaten! Either content me or die at once!\" We are forced\\nto give, for else the old man tramples on us and makes us spew forth all\\nour body contains. There must be an end to it, friend. Let us see! what\\ncan be done? Who will get us out of this mess?\\n\\nNICIAS. The best thing, chum, is our famous \"Let-us-bolt!\"\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. But none can escape the Paphlagonian, his eye is everywhere.\\nAnd what a stride! He has one leg on Pylos and the other in the Assembly;\\nhis rump is exactly over the land of the Chaonians, his hands are with\\nthe Aetolians and his mind with the Clopidians.[14]\\n\\nNICIAS. \\'Tis best then to die; but let us seek the most heroic death.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Let me bethink me, what is the most heroic?\\n\\nNICIAS. Let us drink the blood of a bull; \\'tis the death which\\nThemistocles chose.[15]\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. No, not that, but a bumper of good unmixed wine in honour of\\nthe Good Genius;[16] perchance we may stumble on a happy thought.\\n\\nNICIAS. Look at him! \"Unmixed wine!\" Your mind is on drink intent? Can a\\nman strike out a brilliant thought when drunk?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Without question. Go, ninny, blow yourself out with water;\\ndo you dare to accuse wine of clouding the reason? Quote me more\\nmarvellous effects than those of wine. Look! when a man drinks, he is\\nrich, everything he touches succeeds, he gains lawsuits, is happy and\\nhelps his friends. Come, bring hither quick a flagon of wine, that I may\\nsoak my brain and get an ingenious idea.\\n\\nNICIAS. Eh, my god! What can your drinking do to help us?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Much. But bring it to me, while I take my seat. Once drunk,\\nI shall strew little ideas, little phrases, little reasonings everywhere.\\n\\nNICIAS (_returning with a flagon_). It is lucky I was not caught in the\\nhouse stealing the wine.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Tell me, what is the Paphlagonian doing now?\\n\\nNICIAS. The wretch has just gobbled up some confiscated cakes; he is\\ndrunk and lies at full-length a-snoring on his hides.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Very well, come along, pour me out wine and plenty of it.\\n\\nNICIAS. Take it and offer a libation to your Good Genius; taste, taste\\nthe liquor of the genial soil of Pramnium.[17]\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh, Good Genius! \\'Tis thy will, not mine.\\n\\nNICIAS. Prithee, tell me, what is it?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Run indoors quick and steal the oracles of the Paphlagonian,\\nwhile he is asleep.[18]\\n\\nNICIAS. Bless me! I fear this Good Genius will be but a very Bad Genius\\nfor me.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. And set the flagon near me, that I may moisten my wit to\\ninvent some brilliant notion.\\n\\nNICIAS (_enters the house and returns at once_). How the Paphlagonian\\ngrunts and snores! I was able to seize the sacred oracle, which he was\\nguarding with the greatest care, without his seeing me.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh! clever fellow! Hand it here, that I may read. Come, pour\\nme out some drink, bestir yourself! Let me see what there is in it. Oh!\\nprophecy! Some drink! some drink! Quick!\\n\\nNICIAS. Well! what says the oracle?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Pour again.\\n\\nNICIAS. Is \"pour again\" in the oracle?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh, Bacis![19]\\n\\nNICIAS. But what is in it?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Quick! some drink!\\n\\nNICIAS. Bacis is very dry!\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh! miserable Paphlagonian! This then is why you have so\\nlong taken such precautions; your horoscope gave you qualms of terror.\\n\\nNICIAS. What does it say?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. It says here how he must end.\\n\\nNICIAS. And how?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. How? the oracle announces clearly that a dealer in oakum\\nmust first govern the city.[20]\\n\\nNICIAS. First dealer. And after him, who?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. After him, a sheep-dealer.[21]\\n\\nNICIAS. Two dealers, eh? And what is this one\\'s fate?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. To reign until a greater scoundrel than he arises; then he\\nperishes and in his place the leather-seller appears, the Paphlagonian\\nrobber, the bawler, who roars like a torrent.[22]\\n\\nNICIAS. And the leather-seller must destroy the sheep-seller?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Yes.\\n\\nNICIAS. Oh! woe is me! Where can another seller be found, is there ever a\\none left?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. There is yet one, who plies a firstrate trade.\\n\\nNICIAS. Tell me, pray, what is that?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. You really want to know?\\n\\nNICIAS. Yes.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Well then! \\'tis a sausage-seller who must overthrow him.\\n\\nNICIAS. A sausage-seller! Ah! by Posidon! what a fine trade! But where\\ncan this man be found?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Let us seek him.\\n\\nNICIAS. Lo! there he is, going towards the market-place; \\'tis the gods,\\nthe gods who send him!\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. This way, this way, oh, lucky sausage-seller, come forward,\\ndear friend, our saviour, the saviour of our city.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What is it? Why do you call me?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Come here, come and learn about your good luck, you who are\\nFortune\\'s favourite!\\n\\nNICIAS. Come! Relieve him of his basket-tray and tell him the oracle of\\nthe god; I will go and look after the Paphlagonian.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. First put down all your gear, then worship the earth and the\\ngods.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \\'Tis done. What is the matter?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Happiness, riches, power; to-day you have nothing, to-morrow\\nyou will have all, oh! chief of happy Athens.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Why not leave me to wash my tripe and to sell my sausages\\ninstead of making game of me?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh! the fool! Your tripe! Do you see these tiers of\\npeople?[23]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Yes.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. You shall be master to them all, governor of the market, of\\nthe harbours, of the Pnyx; you shall trample the Senate under foot, be\\nable to cashier the generals, load them with fetters, throw them into\\ngaol, and you will play the debauchee in the Prytaneum.[24]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What! I?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. You, without a doubt. But you do not yet see all the glory\\nawaiting you. Stand on your basket and look at all the islands that\\nsurround Athens.[25]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I see them. What then?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Look at the storehouses and the shipping.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Yes, I am looking.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Exists there a mortal more blest than you? Furthermore, turn\\nyour right eye towards Caria and your left towards Chalcedon.[26]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \\'Tis then a blessing to squint!\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. No, but \\'tis you who are going to trade away all this.\\nAccording to the oracle you must become the greatest of men.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Just tell me how a sausage-seller can become a great man.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. That is precisely why you will be great, because you are a\\nsad rascal without shame, no better than a common market rogue.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I do not hold myself worthy of wielding power.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh! by the gods! Why do you not hold yourself worthy? Have\\nyou then such a good opinion of yourself? Come, are you of honest\\nparentage?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. By the gods! No! of very bad indeed.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Spoilt child of fortune, everything fits together to ensure\\nyour greatness.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But I have not had the least education. I can only read,\\nand that very badly.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. That is what may stand in your way, almost knowing how to\\nread. The demagogues will neither have an educated nor an honest man;\\nthey require an ignoramus and a rogue. But do not, do not let go this\\ngift, which the oracle promises.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But what does the oracle say?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Faith! it is put together in very fine enigmatical style, as\\nelegant as it is clear: \"When the eagle-tanner with the hooked claws\\nshall seize a stupid dragon, a blood-sucker, it will be an end to the hot\\nPaphlagonian pickled garlic. The god grants great glory to the\\nsausage-sellers unless they prefer to sell their wares.\"\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. In what way does this concern me? Pray instruct my\\nignorance.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. The eagle-tanner is the Paphlagonian.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What do the hooked claws mean?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. It means to say, that he robs and pillages us with his\\nclaw-like hands.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And the dragon?\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. That is quite clear. The dragon is long and so also is the\\nsausage; the sausage like the dragon is a drinker of blood. Therefore the\\noracle says, that the dragon will triumph over the eagle-tanner, if he\\ndoes not let himself be cajoled with words.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The oracles of the gods summon me! Faith! I do not at all\\nunderstand how I can be capable of governing the people.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Nothing simpler. Continue your trade. Mix and knead together\\nall the state business as you do for your sausages. To win the people,\\nalways cook them some savoury that pleases them. Besides, you possess all\\nthe attributes of a demagogue; a screeching, horrible voice, a perverse,\\ncross-grained nature and the language of the market-place. In you all is\\nunited which is needful for governing. The oracles are in your favour,\\neven including that of Delphi. Come, take a chaplet, offer a libation to\\nthe god of Stupidity[27] and take care to fight vigorously.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Who will be my ally? for the rich fear the Paphlagonian\\nand the poor shudder at the sight of him.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. You will have a thousand brave Knights,[28] who detest him,\\non your side; also the honest citizens amongst the spectators, those who\\nare men of brave hearts, and finally myself and the god. Fear not, you\\nwill not see his features, for none have dared to make a mask resembling\\nhim. But the public have wit enough to recognize him.[29]\\n\\nNICIAS. Oh! mercy! here is the Paphlagonian!\\n\\nCLEON. By the twelve gods! Woe betide you, who have too long been\\nconspiring against Demos. What means this Chalcidian cup? No doubt you\\nare provoking the Chalcidians to revolt. You shall be killed, butchered,\\nyou brace of rogues.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. What! are you for running away? Come, come, stand firm, bold\\nSausage-seller, do not betray us. To the rescue, oh! Knights. Now is the\\ntime. Simon, Panaetius,[30] get you to the right wing; they are coming\\non; hold tight and return to the charge. I can see the dust of their\\nhorses\\' hoofs; they are galloping to our aid. Courage! Repel, attack\\nthem, put them to flight.\\n\\nCHORUS. Strike, strike the villain, who has spread confusion amongst the\\nranks of the Knights, this public robber, this yawning gulf of plunder,\\nthis devouring Charybdis,[31] this villain, this villain, this villain! I\\ncannot say the word too often, for he _is_ a villain a thousand times a\\nday. Come, strike, drive, hurl him over and crush him to pieces; hate him\\nas we hate him; stun him with your blows and your shouts. And beware lest\\nhe escape you; he knows the way Eucrates[32] took straight to a bran sack\\nfor concealment.\\n\\nCLEON. Oh! veteran Heliasts,[33] brotherhood of the three obols,[34] whom\\nI fostered by bawling at random, help me; I am being beaten to death by\\nrebels.\\n\\nCHORUS. And \\'tis justice; you devour the public funds that all should\\nshare in; you treat the officers answerable for the revenue like the\\nfruit of the fig tree, squeezing them to find which are still green or\\nmore or less ripe; and, when you find one simple and timid, you force him\\nto come from the Chersonese,[35] then you seize him by the middle,\\nthrottle him by the neck, while you twist his shoulder back; he falls and\\nyou devour him.[36] Besides, you know very well how to select from among\\nthe citizens those who are as meek as lambs, rich, without guile and\\nloathers of lawsuits.\\n\\nCLEON. Eh! what! Knights, are you helping them? But, if I am beaten, \\'tis\\nin your cause, for I was going to propose to erect you a statue in the\\ncity in memory of your bravery.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! the impostor! the dull varlet! See! he treats us like old\\ndotards and crawls at our feet to deceive us; but the cunning wherein\\nlies his power shall this time recoil on himself; he trips up himself by\\nresorting to such artifices.\\n\\nCLEON. Oh Citizens! oh people! see how these brutes are bursting my\\nbelly.\\n\\nCHORUS. What shouts! but \\'tis this very bawling that incessantly upsets\\nthe city!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I can shout too--and so loud that you will flee with\\nfear.\\n\\nCHORUS. If you shout louder than he does, I will strike up the triumphal\\nhymn; if you surpass him in impudence, the cake is ours.\\n\\nCLEON. I denounce this fellow; he has had tasty stews exported from\\nAthens for the Spartan fleet.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I denounce him, who runs into the Prytaneum with\\nempty belly and comes out with it full.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. And by Zeus! he carries off bread, meat, and fish, which is\\nforbidden. Pericles himself never had this right.\\n\\nCLEON. You are travelling the right road to get killed.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I\\'ll bawl three times as loud as you.\\n\\nCLEON. I will deafen you with my yells.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I you with my bellowing.\\n\\nCLEON. I shall calumniate you, if you become a Strategus.[37]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Dog, I will lay your back open with the lash.\\n\\nCLEON. I will make you drop your arrogance.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will baffle your machinations.\\n\\nCLEON. Dare to look me in the face!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I too was brought up in the market-place.\\n\\nCLEON. I will cut you to shreds if you whisper a word.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will daub you with dung if you open your mouth.\\n\\nCLEON. I own I am a thief; do you admit yourself another.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. By our Hermes of the market-place, if caught in the act,\\nwhy, I perjure myself before those who saw me.\\n\\nCLEON. These are my own special tricks. I will denounce you to the\\nPrytanes[38] as the owner of sacred tripe, that has not paid tithe.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! you scoundrel! you impudent bawler! everything is filled with\\nyour daring, all Attica, the Assembly, the Treasury, the decrees, the\\ntribunals. As a furious torrent you have overthrown our city; your\\noutcries have deafened Athens and, posted upon a high rock, you have lain\\nin wait for the tribute moneys as the fisherman does for the tunny-fish.\\n\\nCLEON. I know your tricks; \\'tis an old plot resoled.[39]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. If you know naught of soling, I understand nothing of\\nsausages; you, who cut bad leather on the slant to make it look stout and\\ndeceive the country yokels. They had not worn it a day before it had\\nstretched some two spans.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES \\'Tis the very trick he served me; both my neighbours and my\\nfriends laughed heartily at me, and before I reached Pergasae[40] I was\\nswimming in my shoes.\\n\\nCHORUS. Have you not always shown that blatant impudence, which is the\\nsole strength of our orators? You push it so far, that you, the head of\\nthe State, dare to milk the purses of the opulent aliens and, at sight of\\nyou, the son of Hippodamus[41] melts into tears. But here is another man,\\nwho gives me pleasure, for he is a much greater rascal than you; he will\\noverthrow you; \\'tis easy to see, that he will beat you in roguery, in\\nbrazenness and in clever turns. Come, you, who have been brought up among\\nthe class which to-day gives us all our great men, show us that a liberal\\neducation is mere tomfoolery.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Just hear what sort of fellow that fine citizen is.\\n\\nCLEON. Will you not let me speak?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Assuredly not, for I also am a sad rascal.\\n\\nCHORUS. If he does not give in at that, tell him your parents were sad\\nrascals too.\\n\\nCLEON. Once more, will you not let me speak?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, by Zeus!\\n\\nCLEON. Yes, by Zeus, but you shall!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, by Posidon! We will fight first to see who shall\\nspeak first.\\n\\nCLEON. I will die sooner.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will not let you....\\n\\nCHORUS. Let him, in the name of the gods, let him die.\\n\\nCLEON. What makes you so bold as to dare to speak to my face?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \\'Tis that I know both how to speak and how to cook.\\n\\nCLEON. Hah! the fine speaker! Truly, if some business matter fell your\\nway, you would know thoroughly well how to attack it, to carve it up\\nalive! Shall I tell you what has happened to you? Like so many others,\\nyou have gained some petty lawsuit against some alien.[42] Did you drink\\nenough water to inspire you? Did you mutter over the thing sufficiently\\nthrough the night, spout it along the street, recite it to all you met?\\nHave you bored your friends enough with it? \\'Tis then for this you deem\\nyourself an orator. Ah! poor fool!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And what do you drink yourself then, to be able all alone\\nby yourself to dumbfound and stupefy the city so with your clamour?\\n\\nCLEON. Can you match me with a rival? Me! When I have devoured a good hot\\ntunny-fish and drunk on top of it a great jar of unmixed wine, I hold up\\nthe Generals of Pylos to public scorn.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I, when I have bolted the tripe of an ox together\\nwith a sow\\'s belly and swallowed the broth as well, I am fit, though\\nslobbering with grease, to bellow louder than all orators and to terrify\\nNicias.\\n\\nCHORUS. I admire your language so much; the only thing I do not approve\\nis that you swallow all the broth yourself.\\n\\nCLEON. E\\'en though you gorged yourself on sea-dogs, you would not beat\\nthe Milesians.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Give me a bullock\\'s breast to devour, and I am a man to\\ntraffic in mines.[43]\\n\\nCLEON. I will rush into the Senate and set them all by the ears.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I will lug out your gut to stuff like a sausage.\\n\\nCLEON. As for me, I will seize you by the rump and hurl you head foremost\\nthrough the door.\\n\\nCHORUS. In any case, by Posidon, \\'twill only be when you have thrown _me_\\nthere first.[44]\\n\\nCLEON. Beware of the carcan![45]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I denounce you for cowardice.\\n\\nCLEON. I will tan your hide.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will flay you and make a thief\\'s pouch with the skin.\\n\\nCLEON. I will peg you out on the ground.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will slice you into mince-meat.\\n\\nCLEON. I will tear out your eyelashes.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will slit your gullet.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. We will set his mouth open with a wooden stick as the cooks\\ndo with pigs; we will tear out his tongue, and, looking down his gaping\\nthroat, will see whether his inside has any pimples.[46]\\n\\nCHORUS. Thus then at Athens we have something more fiery than fire, more\\nimpudent than impudence itself! \\'Tis a grave matter; come, we will push\\nand jostle him without mercy. There, you grip him tightly under the arms;\\nif he gives way at the onset, you will find him nothing but a craven; I\\nknow my man.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. That he has been all his life and he has only made\\nhimself a name by reaping another\\'s harvest; and now he has tied up the\\nears he gathered over there, he lets them dry and seeks to sell them.[47]\\n\\nCLEON. I do not fear you as long as there is a Senate and a people which\\nstands like a fool, gaping in the air.\\n\\nCHORUS. What unparalleled impudence! \\'Tis ever the same brazen front. If\\nI don\\'t hate you, why, I\\'m ready to take the place of the one blanket\\nCratinus wets;[48] I\\'ll offer to play a tragedy by Morsimus.[49] Oh! you\\ncheat! who turn all into money, who flutter from one extortion to\\nanother; may you disgorge as quickly as you have crammed yourself! Then\\nonly would I sing, \"Let us drink, let us drink to this happy event!\"[50]\\nThen even the son of Iulius,[51] the old niggard, would empty his cup\\nwith transports of joy, crying, \"Io, Paean! Io, Bacchus!\"\\n\\nCLEON. By Posidon! You! would you beat me in impudence! If you succeed,\\nmay I no longer have my share of the victims offered to Zeus on the city\\naltar.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I, I swear by the blows that have so oft rained upon\\nmy shoulders since infancy, and by the knives that have cut me, that I\\nwill show more effrontery than you; as sure as I have rounded this fine\\nstomach by feeding on the pieces of bread that had cleansed other folk\\'s\\ngreasy fingers.[52]\\n\\nCLEON. On pieces of bread, like a dog! Ah! wretch! you have the nature of\\na dog and you dare to fight a cynecephalus?[53]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I have many another trick in my sack, memories of my\\nchildhood\\'s days. I used to linger around the cooks and say to them,\\n\"Look, friends, don\\'t you see a swallow? \\'tis the herald of springtime.\"\\nAnd while they stood, their noses in the air, I made off with a piece of\\nmeat.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! most clever man! How well thought out! You did as the eaters\\nof artichokes, you gathered them before the return of the swallows.[54]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. They could make nothing of it; or, if they suspected a\\ntrick, I hid the meat in my breeches and denied the thing by all the\\ngods; so that an orator, seeing me at the game, cried, \"This child will\\nget on; he has the mettle that makes a statesman.\"\\n\\nCHORUS. He argued rightly; to steal, perjure yourself and make a receiver\\nof your rump[55] are three essentials for climbing high.\\n\\nCLEON. I will stop your insolence, or rather the insolence of both of\\nyou. I will throw myself upon you like a terrible hurricane ravaging both\\nland and sea at the will of its fury.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Then I will gather up my sausages and entrust myself to\\nthe kindly waves of fortune so as to make you all the more enraged.\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. And I will watch in the bilges in case the boat should make\\nwater.\\n\\nCLEON. No, by Demeter! I swear, \\'twill not be with impunity that you have\\nthieved so many talents from the Athenians.[56]\\n\\nCHORUS (_to the Sausage-seller_). Oh! oh! reef your sail a bit! Here is\\nBoreas blowing calumniously.\\n\\nCLEON. I know that you got ten talents out of Potidaea.[57]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Hold! I will give you one; but keep it dark!\\n\\nCHORUS. Hah! that will please him mightily; now you can travel under full\\nsail.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Yes, the wind has lost its violence.\\n\\nCLEON. I will bring four suits against you, each of one hundred\\ntalents.[58]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I twenty against you for shirking duty and more than\\na thousand for robbery.\\n\\nCLEON. I maintain that your parents were guilty of sacrilege against the\\ngoddess.[59]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I, that one of your grandfathers was a satellite....\\n\\nCLEON. To whom? Explain!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. To Byrsina, the mother of Hippias.[60]\\n\\nCLEON. You are an impostor.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And you are a rogue.\\n\\nCHORUS. Hit him hard.\\n\\nCLEON. Oh, oh, dear! The conspirators are murdering me!\\n\\nCHORUS. Strike, strike with all your might; bruise his belly, lashing him\\nwith your guts and your tripe; punish him with both arms! Oh! vigorous\\nassailant and intrepid heart! Have you not routed him totally in this\\nduel of abuse? how shall I give tongue to my joy and sufficiently praise\\nyou?\\n\\nCLEON. Ah! by Demeter! I was not ignorant of this plot against me; I knew\\nit was forming, that the chariot of war was being put together.[61]\\n\\nCHORUS (_to Sausage-seller_). Look out, look out! Come, outfence him with\\nsome wheelwright slang?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. His tricks at Argos do not escape me. Under pretence of\\nforming an alliance with the Argives, he is hatching a plot with the\\nLacedaemonians there; and I know why the bellows are blowing and the\\nmetal that is on the anvil; \\'tis the question of the prisoners.\\n\\nCHORUS. Well done! Forge on, if he be a wheelwright.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And there are men at Sparta[62] who are hammering the\\niron with you; but neither gold nor silver nor prayers nor anything else\\nshall impede my denouncing your trickery to the Athenians.\\n\\nCLEON. As for me, I hasten to the Senate to reveal your plotting, your\\nnightly gatherings in the city, your trafficking with the Medes and with\\nthe Great King, and all you are foraging for in Boeotia.[63]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What price then is paid for forage by Boeotians?\\n\\nCLEON. Oh! by Heracles! I will tan your hide.\\n\\nCHORUS. Come, if you have both wit and heart, now is the time to show it,\\nas on the day when you hid the meat in your breeches, as you say. Hasten\\nto the Senate, for he will rush there like a tornado to calumniate us all\\nand give vent to his fearful bellowings.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I am going, but first I must rid myself of my tripe and\\nmy knives; I will leave them here.\\n\\nCHORUS. Stay! rub your neck with lard; in this way you will slip between\\nthe fingers of calumny.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Spoken like a finished master of fence.\\n\\nCHORUS. Now, bolt down these cloves of garlic.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Pray, what for?\\n\\nCHORUS. Well primed with garlic, you will have greater mettle for the\\nfight. But hurry, hurry, bestir yourself!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. That\\'s just what I am doing.\\n\\nCHORUS. And, above all, bite your foe, rend him to atoms, tear off his\\ncomb[64] and do not return until you have devoured his wattles. Go! make\\nyour attack with a light heart, avenge me and may Zeus guard you! I burn\\nto see you return the victor and laden with chaplets of glory. And you,\\nspectators, enlightened critics of all kinds of poetry, lend an ear to my\\nanapaests.[65]\\n\\nCHORUS. Had one of the old authors asked to mount this stage to recite\\nhis verses, he would not have found it hard to persuade me. But our poet\\nof to-day is likewise worthy of this favour; he shares our hatred, he\\ndares to tell the truth, he boldly braves both waterspouts and\\nhurricanes. Many among you, he tells us, have expressed wonder, that he\\nhas not long since had a piece presented in his own name, and have asked\\nthe reason why.[66] This is what he bids us say in reply to your\\nquestions; \\'tis not without grounds that he has courted the shade, for,\\nin his opinion, nothing is more difficult than to cultivate the comic\\nMuse; many court her, but very few secure her favours. Moreover, he knows\\nthat you are fickle by nature and betray your poets when they grow old.\\nWhat fate befell Magnes,[67] when his hair went white? Often enough has\\nhe triumphed over his rivals; he has sung in all keys, played the lyre\\nand fluttered wings; he turned into a Lydian and even into a gnat, daubed\\nhimself with green to become a frog.[68] All in vain! When young, you\\napplauded him; in his old age you hooted and mocked him, because his\\ngenius for raillery had gone. Cratinus[69] again was like a torrent of\\nglory rushing across the plain, uprooting oak, plane tree and rivals and\\nbearing them pell-mell in its wake. The only songs at the banquet were,\\n\\'Doro, shod with lying tales\\' and \\'Adepts of the Lyric Muse\\';[70] so\\ngreat was his renown. Look at him now! he drivels, his lyre has neither\\nstrings nor keys, his voice quivers, but you have no pity for him, and\\nyou let him wander about as he can, like Connas,[71] his temples circled\\nwith a withered chaplet; the poor old fellow is dying of thirst; he who,\\nin honour of his glorious past, should be in the Prytaneum drinking at\\nhis ease, and instead of trudging the country should be sitting amongst\\nthe first row of the spectators, close to the statue of Dionysus[72] and\\nloaded with perfumes. Crates,[73] again, have you done hounding him with\\nyour rage and your hisses? True, \\'twas but meagre fare that his sterile\\nMuse could offer you; a few ingenious fancies formed the sole\\ningredients, but nevertheless he knew how to stand firm and to recover\\nfrom his falls. \\'Tis such examples that frighten our poet; in addition,\\nhe would tell himself, that before being a pilot, he must first know how\\nto row, then to keep watch at the prow, after that how to gauge the\\nwinds, and that only then would he be able to command his vessel.[74] If\\nthen you approve this wise caution and his resolve that he would not bore\\nyou with foolish nonsense, raise loud waves of applause in his favour\\nthis day, so that, at this Lenaean feast, the breath of your favour may\\nswell the sails of his trumphant galley and the poet may withdraw proud\\nof his success, with head erect and his face beaming with delight.\\n\\nPosidon, god of the racing steed, I salute you, you who delight in their\\nneighing and in the resounding clatter of their brass-shod hoofs, god of\\nthe swift galleys, which, loaded with mercenaries, cleave the seas with\\ntheir azure beaks, god of the equestrian contests, in which young rivals,\\neager for glory, ruin themselves for the sake of distinction with their\\nchariots in the arena, come and direct our chorus; Posidon with the\\ntrident of gold, you, who reign over the dolphins, who are worshipped at\\nSunium and at Geraestus[75] beloved of Phormio,[76] and dear to the whole\\ncity above all the immortals, I salute you!\\n\\nLet us sing the glory of our forefathers; ever victors, both on land and\\nsea, they merit that Athens, rendered famous by these, her worthy sons,\\nshould write their deeds upon the sacred peplus.[77] As soon as they saw\\nthe enemy, they at once sprang at him without ever counting his strength.\\nShould one of them fall in the conflict, he would shake off the dust,\\ndeny his mishap and begin the struggle anew. Not one of these Generals of\\nold time would have asked Cleaenetus[78] to be fed at the cost of the\\nstate; but our present men refuse to fight, unless they get the honours\\nof the Prytaneum and precedence in their seats. As for us, we place our\\nvalour gratuitously at the service of Athens and of her gods; our only\\nhope is, that, should peace ever put a term to our toils, you will not\\ngrudge us our long, scented hair nor our delicate care for our toilet.\\n\\nOh! Pallas, guardian of Athens, you, who reign over the most pious city,\\nthe most powerful, the richest in warriors and in poets, hasten to my\\ncall, bringing in your train our faithful ally in all our expeditions and\\ncombats, Victory, who smiles on our choruses and fights with us against\\nour rivals. Oh! goddess! manifest yourself to our sight; this day more\\nthan ever we deserve that you should ensure our triumph.\\n\\nWe will sing likewise the exploits of our steeds! they are worthy of our\\npraises;[79] in what invasions, what fights have I not seen them helping\\nus! But especially admirable were they, when they bravely leapt upon the\\ngalleys, taking nothing with them but a coarse wine, some cloves of\\ngarlic and onions; despite this, they nevertheless seized the sweeps just\\nlike men, curved their backs over the thwarts and shouted, \"Hippopopoh!\\nGive way! Come, all pull together! Come, come! How! Samphoras![80] Are\\nyou not rowing?\" They rushed down upon the coast of Corinth, and the\\nyoungest hollowed out beds in the sand with their hoofs or went to fetch\\ncoverings; instead of luzern, they had no food but crabs, which they\\ncaught on the strand and even in the sea; so that Theorus causes a\\nCorinthian[81] crab to say, \"\\'Tis a cruel fate, oh Posidon! neither my\\ndeep hiding-places, whether on land or at sea, can help me to escape the\\nKnights.\"\\n\\nWelcome, oh, dearest and bravest of men! How distracted I have been\\nduring your absence! But here you are back, safe and sound. Tell us about\\nthe fight you have had.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The important thing is that I have beaten the Senate.[82]\\n\\nCHORUS. All glory to you! Let us burst into shouts of joy! You speak\\nwell, but your deeds are even better. Come, tell me everything in detail;\\nwhat a long journey would I not be ready to take to hear your tale! Come,\\ndear friend, speak with full confidence to your admirers.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The story is worth hearing. Listen! From here I rushed\\nstraight to the Senate, right in the track of this man; he was already\\nletting loose the storm, unchaining the lightning, crushing the Knights\\nbeneath huge mountains of calumnies heaped together and having all the\\nair of truth; he called you conspirators and his lies caught root like\\nweeds in every mind; dark were the looks on every side and brows were\\nknitted. When I saw that the Senate listened to him favourably and was\\nbeing tricked by his imposture, I said to myself, \"Come, gods of rascals\\nand braggarts, gods of all fools, toad-eaters and braggarts and thou,\\nmarket-place, where I was bred from my earliest days, give me unbridled\\naudacity, an untiring chatter and a shameless voice.\" No sooner had I\\nended this prayer than a lewd man broke wind on my right. \"Hah! \\'tis a\\ngood omen,\" said I, and prostrated myself; then I burst open the door by\\na vigorous push with my back, and, opening my mouth to the utmost,\\nshouted, \"Senators, I wanted you to be the first to hear the good news;\\nsince the War broke out, I have never seen anchovies at a lower price!\"\\nAll faces brightened at once and I was voted a chaplet for my good\\ntidings; and I added, \"With a couple of words I will reveal to you, how\\nyou can have quantities of anchovies for an obol; \\'tis to seize on all\\nthe dishes the merchants have.\" With mouths gaping with admiration, they\\napplauded me. However, the Paphlagonian winded the matter and, well\\nknowing the sort of language which pleases the Senate best, said,\\n\"Friends, I am resolved to offer one hundred oxen to the goddess in\\nrecognition of this happy event.\" The Senate at once veered to his side.\\nSo when I saw myself defeated by this ox filth, I outbade the fellow,\\ncrying, \"Two hundred!\" And beyond this I moved, that a vow be made to\\nDiana of a thousand goats if the next day anchovies should only be worth\\nan obol a hundred. And the Senate looked towards me again. The other,\\nstunned with the blow, grew delirious in his speech, and at last the\\nPrytanes and the guards dragged him out. The Senators then stood talking\\nnoisily about the anchovies. Cleon, however, begged them to listen to the\\nLacedaemonian envoy, who had come to make proposals of peace; but all\\nwith one accord, cried, \"\\'Tis certainly not the moment to think of peace\\nnow! If anchovies are so cheap, what need have we of peace? Let the war\\ntake its course!\" And with loud shouts they demanded that the Prytanes\\nshould close the sitting and then leapt over the rails in all directions.\\nAs for me, I slipped away to buy all the coriander seed and leeks there\\nwere on the market and gave it to them gratis as seasoning for their\\nanchovies. \\'Twas marvellous! They loaded me with praises and caresses;\\nthus I conquered the Senate with an obol\\'s worth of leeks, and here I am.\\n\\nCHORUS. Bravo! you are the spoilt child of Fortune. Ah! our knave has\\nfound his match in another, who has far better tricks in his sack, a\\nthousand kinds of knaveries and of wily words. But the fight begins\\nafresh; take care not to weaken; you know that I have long been your most\\nfaithful ally.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! ah! here comes the Paphlagonian! One would say, \\'twas\\na hurricane lashing the sea and rolling the waves before it in its fury.\\nHe looks as if he wanted to swallow me up alive! Ye gods! what an\\nimpudent knave!\\n\\nCLEON. To my aid, my beloved lies! I am going to destroy you, or my name\\nis lost.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh! how he diverts me with his threats! His bluster makes\\nme laugh! And I dance the _mothon_ for joy,[83] and sing at the top of my\\nvoice, cuckoo!\\n\\nCLEON. Ah! by Demeter! if I do not kill and devour you, may I die!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. If you do not devour me? and I, if I do not drink your\\nblood to the last drop, and then burst with indigestion.\\n\\nCLEON. I, I will strangle you, I swear it by the precedence which Pylos\\ngained me.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. By the precedence! Ah! might I see you fall from your\\nprecedence into the hindmost seat!\\n\\nCLEON. By heaven! I will put you to the torture.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What a lively wit! Come, what\\'s the best to give you to\\neat? What do you prefer? A purse?\\n\\nCLEON. I will tear out your inside with my nails.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I will cut off your victuals at the Prytaneum.\\n\\nCLEON. I will haul you before Demos, who will mete out justice to you.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I too will drag you before him and belch forth more\\ncalumnies than you.\\n\\nCLEON. Why, poor fool, he does not believe you, whereas I play with him\\nat will.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. So that Demos is your property, your contemptible\\ncreature.\\n\\nCLEON. \\'Tis because I know the dishes that please him.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And these are little mouthfuls, which you serve to him\\nlike a clever nurse. You chew the pieces and place some in small\\nquantities in his mouth, while you swallow three parts yourself.\\n\\nCLEON. Thanks to my skill, I know exactly how to enlarge or contract this\\ngullet.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I can do as much with my rump.\\n\\nCLEON. Hah! my friend, you tricked me at the Senate, but have a care! Let\\nus go before Demos.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. That\\'s easily done; come, let\\'s along without delay.\\n\\nCLEON. Oh, Demos! Come, I adjure you to help me, my father!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Come, oh, my dear little Demos; come and see how I am\\ninsulted.\\n\\nDEMOS. What a hubbub! To the Devil with you, bawlers! alas! my olive\\nbranch, which they have torn down![84] Ah! \\'tis you, Paphlagonian. And\\nwho, pray, has been maltreating you?\\n\\nCLEON. You are the cause of this man and these young people having\\ncovered me with blows.\\n\\nDEMOS. And why?\\n\\nCLEON Because you love me passionately, Demos.\\n\\nDEMOS. And you, who are you?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. His rival. For many a long year have I loved you, have I\\nwished to do you honour, I and a crowd of other men of means. But this\\nrascal here has prevented us. You resemble those young men who do not\\nknow where to choose their lovers; you repulse honest folk; to earn your\\nfavours, one has to be a lamp-seller, a cobbler, a tanner or a currier.\\n\\nCLEON. I am the benefactor of the people.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. In what way, an it please you?\\n\\nCLEON. In what way? I supplanted the Generals at Pylos, I hurried thither\\nand I brought back the Laconian captives.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I, whilst simply loitering, cleared off with a pot\\nfrom a shop, which another fellow had been boiling.\\n\\nCLEON. Demos, convene the assembly at once to decide which of us two\\nloves you best and most merits your favour.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Yes, yes, provided it be not at the Pnyx.\\n\\nDEMOS. I could not sit elsewhere; \\'tis at the Pnyx, that you must appear\\nbefore me.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! great gods! I am undone! At home this old fellow is\\nthe most sensible of men, but the instant he is seated on those cursed\\nstone seats,[85] he is there with mouth agape as if he were hanging up\\nfigs by their stems to dry.\\n\\nCHORUS. Come, loose all sail. Be bold, skilful in attack and entangle him\\nin arguments which admit of no reply. It is difficult to beat him, for he\\nis full of craft and pulls himself out of the worst corners. Collect all\\nyour forces to come forth from this fight covered with glory, but take\\ncare! Let him not assume the attack, get ready your grapples and advance\\nwith your vessel to board him!\\n\\nCLEON. Oh! guardian goddess of our city! oh! Athené! if it be true that\\nnext to Lysicles, Cynna and Salabaccha[86] none have done so much good\\nfor the Athenian people as I, suffer me to continue to be fed at the\\nPrytaneum without working; but if I hate you, if I am not ready to fight\\nin your defence alone and against all, may I perish, be sawn to bits\\nalive and my skin be cut up into thongs.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I, Demos, if it be not true, that I love and cherish\\nyou, may I be cooked in a stew; and if that is not saying enough, may I\\nbe grated on this table with some cheese and then hashed, may a hook be\\npassed through my testicles and let me be dragged thus to the\\nCeramicus![87]\\n\\nCLEON. Is it possible, Demos, to love you more than I do? And firstly, as\\nlong as you have governed with my consent, have I not filled your\\ntreasury, putting pressure on some, torturing others or begging of them,\\nindifferent to the opinion of private individuals, and solely anxious to\\nplease you?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. There is nothing so wonderful in all that, Demos; I will\\ndo as much; I will thieve the bread of others to serve up to you. No, he\\nhas neither love for you nor kindly feeling; his only care is to warm\\nhimself with your wood, and I will prove it. You, who, sword in hand,\\nsaved Attica from the Median yoke at Marathon; you, whose glorious\\ntriumphs we love to extol unceasingly, look, he cares little whether he\\nsees you seated uncomfortably upon a stone; whereas I, I bring you this\\ncushion, which I have sewn with my own hands. Rise and try this nice soft\\nseat. Did you not put enough strain on your breeches at Salamis?[88]\\n\\nDEMOS. Who are you then? Can you be of the race of Harmodius?[89] Upon my\\nfaith, \\'tis nobly done and like a true friend of Demos.\\n\\nCLEON. Petty flattery to prove him your goodwill!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But you have caught him with even smaller baits!\\n\\nCLEON. Never had Demos a defender or a friend more devoted than myself;\\non my head, on my life, I swear it!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. You pretend to love him and for eight years you have seen\\nhim housed in casks, in crevices and dovecots,[90] where he is blinded\\nwith the smoke, and you lock him in without pity; Archeptolemus brought\\npeace and you tore it to ribbons; the envoys who come to propose a truce\\nyou drive from the city with kicks in their backsides.\\n\\nCLEON. This is that Demos may rule over all the Greeks; for the oracles\\npredict that, if he is patient, he must one day sit as judge in Arcadia\\nat five obols per day. Meanwhile, I will nourish him, look after him and,\\nabove all, I will ensure to him his three obols.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, little you care for his reigning in Arcadia, \\'tis to\\npillage and impose on the allies at will that you reckon; you wish the\\nWar to conceal your rogueries as in a mist, that Demos may see nothing of\\nthem, and harassed by cares, may only depend on yourself for his bread.\\nBut if ever peace is restored to him, if ever he returns to his lands to\\ncomfort himself once more with good cakes, to greet his cherished olives,\\nhe will know the blessings you have kept him out of, even though paying\\nhim a salary; and, filled with hatred and rage, he will rise, burning\\nwith desire to vote against you. You know this only too well; \\'tis for\\nthis you rock him to sleep with your lies.\\n\\nCLEON. Is it not shameful, that you should dare thus to calumniate me\\nbefore Demos, me, to whom Athens, I swear it by Demeter, already owes\\nmore than it ever did to Themistocles?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh! citizens of Argos, do you hear what he says?[91] You\\ndare to compare yourself to Themistocles, who found our city half empty\\nand left it full to overflowing, who one day gave us the Piraeus for\\ndinner,[92] and added fresh fish to all our usual meals.[93] You, on the\\ncontrary, you, who compare yourself with Themistocles, have only sought\\nto reduce our city in size, to shut it within its walls, to chant oracles\\nto us. And Themistocles goes into exile, while you gorge yourself on the\\nmost excellent fare.\\n\\nCLEON. Oh! Demos! Am I compelled to hear myself thus abused, and merely\\nbecause I love you?\\n\\nDEMOS. Silence! stop your abuse! All too long have I been your tool.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! my dear little Demos, he is a rogue, who has played\\nyou many a scurvy trick; when your back is turned, he taps at the root\\nthe lawsuits initiated by the peculators, swallows the proceeds wholesale\\nand helps himself with both hands from the public funds.\\n\\nCLEON. Tremble, knave; I will convict you of having stolen thirty\\nthousand drachmae.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. For a rascal of your kidney, you shout rarely! Well! I am\\nready to die if I do not prove that you have accepted more than forty\\nminae from the Mitylenaeans.[94]\\n\\nCHORUS. This indeed may be termed talking. Oh, benefactor of the human\\nrace, proceed and you will be the most illustrious of the Greeks. You\\nalone shall have sway in Athens, the allies will obey you, and, trident\\nin hand, you will go about shaking and overturning everything to enrich\\nyourself. But, stick to your man, let him not go; with lungs like yours\\nyou will soon have him finished.\\n\\nCLEON. No, my brave friends, no, you are running too fast; I have done a\\nsufficiently brilliant deed to shut the mouth of all enemies, so long as\\none of the bucklers of Pylos remains.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Of the bucklers! Hold! I stop you there and I hold you\\nfast. For if it be true, that you love the people, you would not allow\\nthese to be hung up with their rings;[95] but \\'tis with an intent you\\nhave done this. Demos, take knowledge of his guilty purpose; in this way\\nyou no longer can punish him at your pleasure. Note the swarm of young\\ntanners, who really surround him, and close to them the sellers of honey\\nand cheese; all these are at one with him. Very well! you have but to\\nfrown, to speak of ostracism and they will rush at night to these\\nbucklers, take them down and seize our granaries.\\n\\nDEMOS. Great gods! what! the bucklers retain their rings! Scoundrel! ah!\\ntoo long have you had me for your tool, cheated and played with me!\\n\\nCLEON. But, dear sir, never you believe all he tells you. Oh! never will\\nyou find a more devoted friend than me; unaided, I have known how to put\\ndown the conspiracies; nothing that is a-hatching in the city escapes me,\\nand I hasten to proclaim it loudly.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. You are like the fishers for eels; in still waters they\\ncatch nothing, but if they thoroughly stir up the slime, their fishing is\\ngood; in the same way \\'tis only in troublous times that you line your\\npockets. But come, tell me, you, who sell so many skins, have you ever\\nmade him a present of a pair of soles for his slippers? and you pretend\\nto love him!\\n\\nDEMOS. No, he has never given me any.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. That alone shows up the man; but I, I have bought you\\nthis pair of shoes; accept them.\\n\\nDEMOS. None ever, to my knowledge, has merited so much from the people;\\nyou are the most zealous of all men for your country and for my toes.\\n\\nCLEON. Can a wretched pair of slippers make you forget all that you owe\\nme? Is it not I who curbed Gryttus,[96] the filthiest of the lewd, by\\ndepriving him of his citizen rights?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! noble inspector of back passages, let me congratulate\\nyou. Moreover, if you set yourself against this form of lewdness, this\\npederasty, \\'twas for sheer jealousy, knowing it to be the school for\\norators.[97] But you see this poor Demos without a cloak and that at his\\nage too! so little do you care for him, that in mid-winter you have not\\ngiven him a garment with sleeves. Here, Demos, here is one, take it!\\n\\nDEMOS. This even Themistocles never thought of; the Piraeus was no doubt\\na happy idea, but meseems this tunic is quite as fine an invention.\\n\\nCLEON. Must you have recourse to such jackanapes\\' tricks to supplant me?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, \\'tis your own tricks that I am borrowing, just as a\\nguest, driven by urgent need, seizes some other man\\'s shoes.[98]\\n\\nCLEON. Oh! you shall not outdo me in flattery! I am going to hand Demos\\nthis garment; all that remains to you, you rogue, is to go and hang\\nyourself.\\n\\nDEMOS. Faugh! may the plague seize you! You stink of leather\\nhorribly.[99]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Why, \\'tis to smother you that he has thrown this cloak\\naround you on top of the other; and it is not the first plot he has\\nplanned against you. Do you remember the time when silphium[100] was so\\ncheap?\\n\\nDEMOS. Aye, to be sure I do!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Very well! it was Cleon who had caused the price to fall\\nso low so that all could eat it and the jurymen in the Courts were almost\\npoisoned with farting in each others\\' faces.\\n\\nDEMOS. Hah! why, indeed, a scavenger told me the same thing.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Were you not yourself in those days quite red in the\\ngills with farting?\\n\\nDEMOS. Why, \\'twas a trick worthy of Pyrrandrus![101]\\n\\nCLEON. With what other idle trash will you seek to ruin me, you wretch!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh! I shall be more brazen than you, for \\'tis the goddess\\nwho has commanded me.[102]\\n\\nCLEON. No, on my honour, you will not! Here, Demos, feast on this dish;\\nit is your salary as a dicast, which you gain through me for doing\\nnaught.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Hold! here is a little box of ointment to rub into the\\nsores on your legs.\\n\\nCLEON. I will pluck out your white hairs and make you young again.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Take this hare\\'s scut to wipe the rheum from your eyes.\\n\\nCLEON. When you wipe your nose, clean your fingers on my head.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, on mine.\\n\\nCLEON. On mine. (_To the Sausage-seller._) I will have you made a\\ntrierarch[103] and you will get ruined through it; I will arrange that\\nyou are given an old vessel with rotten sails, which you will have to\\nrepair constantly and at great cost.\\n\\nCHORUS. Our man is on the boil; enough, enough, he is boiling over;\\nremove some of the embers from under him and skim off his threats.\\n\\nCLEON. I will punish your self-importance; I will crush you with imposts;\\nI will have you inscribed on the list of the rich.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. For me no threats--only one simple wish. That you may be\\nhaving some cuttle-fish fried on the stove just as you are going to set\\nforth to plead the cause of the Milesians,[104] which, if you gain, means\\na talent in your pocket; that you hurry over devouring the fish to rush\\noff to the Assembly; suddenly you are called and run off with your mouth\\nfull so as not to lose the talent and choke yourself. There! that is my\\nwish.\\n\\nCHORUS. Splendid! by Zeus, Apollo and Demeter!\\n\\nDEMOS. Faith! here is an excellent citizen indeed, such as has not been\\nseen for a long time. \\'Tis truly a man of the lowest scum! As for you,\\nPaphlagonian, who pretend to love me, you only feed me on garlic. Return\\nme my ring, for you cease to be my steward.\\n\\nCLEON. Here it is, but be assured, that if you bereave me of my power, my\\nsuccessor will be worse than I am.\\n\\nDEMOS. This cannot be my ring; I see another device, unless I am going\\npurblind.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What was your device?\\n\\nDEMOS. A fig-leaf, stuffed with bullock\\'s fat.[105]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, that is not it.\\n\\nDEMOS. What is it then?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \\'Tis a gull with beak wide open, haranguing from the top\\nof a stone.[106]\\n\\nDEMOS. Ah! great gods!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What is the matter?\\n\\nDEMOS. Away! away out of my sight! \\'Tis not my ring he had, \\'twas that of\\nCleonymus. (_To the Sausage-seller_.) Hold, I give you this one; you\\nshall be my steward.\\n\\nCLEON. Master, I adjure you, decide nothing till you have heard my\\noracles.[107]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And mine.\\n\\nCLEON. If you believe him, you will have to suck his tool for him.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. If you listen to him, you\\'ll have to let him skin your\\npenis to the very stump.\\n\\nCLEON. My oracles say that you are to reign over the whole earth, crowned\\nwith chaplets.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And mine say that, clothed in an embroidered purple robe,\\nyou shall pursue Smicythes and her spouse,[108] standing in a chariot of\\ngold and with a crown on your head.\\n\\nDEMOS. Go, fetch me your oracles, that the Paphlagonian may hear them.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Willingly.\\n\\nDEMOS. And you yours.\\n\\nCLEON. I run.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I run too; nothing could suit me better!\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! happy day for us and for our children, if Cleon perish. Yet\\njust now I heard some old cross-grained pleaders on the market-place who\\nhold not this opinion discoursing together. Said they, \"If Cleon had not\\nhad the power we should have lacked two most useful tools, the pestle and\\nthe soup-ladle.\"[109] You also know what a pig\\'s education he has had;\\nhis school-fellows can recall that he only liked the Dorian style and\\nwould study no other; his music-master in displeasure sent him away,\\nsaying: \"This youth in matters of harmony, will only learn the Dorian\\nstyle because \\'tis akin to bribery.\"[110]\\n\\nCLEON. There, behold and look at this heap; and yet I do not bring all.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ugh! I pant and puff under the weight and yet I do not\\nbring all.\\n\\nDEMOS. What are these?\\n\\nCLEON. Oracles.\\n\\nDEMOS. All these?\\n\\nCLEON. Does that astonish you? Why, I have another whole boxful of them.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I the whole of my attics and two rooms besides.\\n\\nDEMOS. Come, let us see, whose are these oracles?\\n\\nCLEON. Mine are those of Bacis.[111]\\n\\nDEMOS (_to the Sausage-seller_). And whose are yours?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Glanis\\'s, the elder brother of Bacis.[112]\\n\\nDEMOS. And of what do they speak?\\n\\nCLEON. Of Athens, of Pylos, of you, of me, of all.\\n\\nDEMOS. And yours?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Of Athens, of lentils, of Lacedaemonians, of fresh\\nmackerel, of scoundrelly flour-sellers, of you, of me. Ah! ha! now let\\nhim gnaw his own penis with chagrin!\\n\\nDEMOS. Come, read them out to me and especially that one I like so much,\\nwhich says that I shall become an eagle and soar among the clouds.\\n\\nCLEON. Then listen and be attentive! \"Son of Erectheus,[113] understand\\nthe meaning of the words, which the sacred tripods set resounding in the\\nsanctuary of Apollo. Preserve the sacred dog with the jagged teeth, that\\nbarks and howls in your defence; he will ensure you a salary and, if he\\nfails, will perish as the victim of the swarms of jays that hunt him down\\nwith their screams.\"\\n\\nDEMOS. By Demeter! I do not understand a word of it. What connection is\\nthere between Erectheus, the jays and the dog?\\n\\nCLEON. \\'Tis I who am the dog, since I bark in your defence. Well! Phoebus\\ncommands you to keep and cherish your dog.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \\'Tis not so spoken by the god; this dog seems to me to\\ngnaw at the oracles as others gnaw at doorposts. Here is exactly what\\nApollo says of the dog.\\n\\nDEMOS. Let us hear, but I must first pick up a stone; an oracle which\\nspeaks of a dog might bite me.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \"Son of Erectheus, beware of this Cerberus that enslaves\\nfreemen; he fawns upon you with his tail, when you are dining, but he is\\nlying in wait to devour your dishes, should you turn your head an\\ninstant; at night he sneaks into the kitchen and, true dog that he is,\\nlicks up with one lap of his tongue both your dishes and ... the\\nislands.\"[114]\\n\\nDEMOS. Faith, Glanis, you speak better than your brother.\\n\\nCLEON. Condescend again to hear me and then judge: \"A woman in sacred\\nAthens will be delivered of a lion, who shall fight for the people\\nagainst clouds of gnats with the same ferocity as if he were defending\\nhis whelps; care ye for him, erect wooden walls around him and towers of\\nbrass.\" Do you understand that?\\n\\nDEMOS. Not the least bit in the world.\\n\\nCLEON. The god tells you here to look after me, for, \\'tis I who am your\\nlion.\\n\\nDEMOS. How! You have become a lion and I never knew a thing about it?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. There is only one thing which he purposely keeps from\\nyou; he does not say what this wall of wood and brass is in which Apollo\\nwarns you to keep and guard him.\\n\\nDEMOS. What does the god mean, then?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. He advises you to fit him into a five-holed wooden\\ncollar.\\n\\nDEMOS. Hah! I think that oracle is about to be fulfilled.\\n\\nCLEON. Do not believe it; these are but jealous crows, that caw against\\nme; but never cease to cherish your good hawk; never forget that he\\nbrought you those Lacedaemonian fish, loaded with chains.[115]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! if the Paphlagonian ran any risk that day, \\'twas\\nbecause he was drunk. Oh, too credulous son of Cecrops,[116] do you\\naccept that as a glorious exploit? A woman would carry a heavy burden if\\nonly a man had put it on her shoulders. But to fight! Go to! he would\\nshit himself, if ever it came to a tussle.\\n\\nCLEON. Note this Pylos in front of Pylos, of which the oracle speaks,\\n\"Pylos is before Pylos.\"[117]\\n\\nDEMOS. How \"in front of Pylos\"? What does he mean by that?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. He says he will seize upon your bath-tubs.[118]\\n\\nDEMOS. Then I shall not bathe to-day.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, as he has stolen our baths. But here is an oracle\\nabout the fleet, to which I beg your best attention.\\n\\nDEMOS. Read on! I am listening; let us first see how we are to pay our\\nsailors.[119]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \"Son of Aegeus,[120] beware of the tricks of the\\ndog-fox,[121] he bites from the rear and rushes off at full speed; he is\\nnothing but cunning and perfidy.\" Do you know what the oracle intends to\\nsay?\\n\\nDEMOS. The dog-fox is Philostratus.[122]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, no, \\'tis Cleon; he is incessantly asking you for\\nlight vessels to go and collect the tributes, and Apollo advises you not\\nto grant them.\\n\\nDEMOS. What connection is there between a galley and a dog-fox?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What connection? Why, \\'tis quite plain--a galley travels\\nas fast as a dog.\\n\\nDEMOS. Why, then, does the oracle not say dog instead of dog-fox?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Because he compares the soldiers to young foxes, who,\\nlike them, eat the grapes in the fields.\\n\\nDEMOS. Good! Well then! how am I to pay the wages of my young foxes?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will undertake that, and in three days too! But listen\\nto this further oracle, by which Apollo puts you on your guard against\\nthe snares of the greedy fist.\\n\\nDEMOS. Of what greedy fist?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The god in this oracle very clearly points to the hand of\\nCleon, who incessantly holds his out, saying, \"Fill it.\"\\n\\nCLEON. \\'Tis false! Phoebus means the hand of Diopithes.[123] But here I\\nhave a winged oracle, which promises you shall become an eagle and rule\\nover all the earth.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I have one, which says that you shall be King of the\\nEarth and of the Sea, and that you shall administer justice in Ecbatana,\\neating fine rich stews the while.\\n\\nCLEON. I have seen Athené[124] in a dream, pouring out full vials of\\nriches and health over the people.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I too have seen the goddess, descending from the\\nAcropolis with an owl perched upon her helmet; on your head she was\\npouring out ambrosia, on that of Cleon garlic pickle.\\n\\nDEMOS. Truly Glanis is the wisest of men. I shall yield myself to you;\\nguide me in my old age and educate me anew.\\n\\nCLEON. Ah! I adjure you! not yet; wait a little; I will promise to\\ndistribute barley every day.\\n\\nDEMOS. Ah! I will not hear another word about barley; you have cheated me\\ntoo often already, both you and Theophanes.[125]\\n\\nCLEON. Well then! you shall have flour-cakes all piping hot.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will give you cakes too, and nice cooked fish; you will\\nonly have to eat.\\n\\nDEMOS. Very well, mind you keep your promises. To whichever of you twain\\nshall treat me best I hand over the reins of state.\\n\\nCLEON. I will be first.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, no, _I_ will.\\n\\nCHORUS. Demos, you are our all-powerful sovereign lord; all tremble\\nbefore you, yet you are led by the nose. You love to be flattered and\\nfooled; you listen to the orators with gaping mouth and your mind is led\\nastray.\\n\\nDEMOS. \\'Tis rather you who have no brains, if you think me so foolish as\\nall that; it is with a purpose that I play this idiot\\'s role, for I love\\nto drink the lifelong day, and so it pleases me to keep a thief for my\\nminister. When he has thoroughly gorged himself, then I overthrow and\\ncrush him.\\n\\nCHORUS. What profound wisdom! If it be really so, why! all is for the\\nbest. Your ministers, then, are your victims, whom you nourish and feed\\nup expressly in the Pnyx, so that, the day your dinner is ready, you may\\nimmolate the fattest and eat him.\\n\\nDEMOS. Look, see how I play with them, while all the time they think\\nthemselves such adepts at cheating me. I have my eye on them when they\\nthieve, but I do not appear to be seeing them; then I thrust a judgment\\ndown their throat as it were a feather, and force them to vomit up all\\nthey have robbed from me.\\n\\nCLEON. Oh! the rascal!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh! the scoundrel!\\n\\nCLEON. Demos, all is ready these three hours; I await your orders and I\\nburn with desire to load you with benefits.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I ten, twelve, a thousand hours, a long, long while,\\nan infinitely long while.\\n\\nDEMOS. As for me, \\'tis thirty thousand hours that I have been impatient;\\nvery long, infinitely long that I have cursed you.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Do you know what you had best do?\\n\\nDEMOS. If I do not, tell me.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Declare the lists open[126] and we will contend abreast\\nto determine who shall treat you the best.\\n\\nDEMOS. Splendid! Draw back in line![126]\\n\\nCLEON. I am ready.\\n\\nDEMOS. Off you go!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER (_to Cleon_). I shall not let you get to the tape.\\n\\nDEMOS. What fervent lovers! If I am not to-day the happiest of men, \\'tis\\nbecause I shall be the most disgusted.\\n\\nCLEON. Look! \\'tis I who am the first to bring you a seat.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I a table.\\n\\nCLEON. Hold, here is a cake kneaded of Pylos barley.[127]\\n\\nSAUSAGE--SELLER. Here are crusts, which the ivory hand of the goddess has\\nhallowed.[128]\\n\\nDEMOS. Oh! Mighty Athené! How large are your fingers!\\n\\nCLEON. This is pea-soup, as exquisite as it is fine; \\'tis Pallas the\\nvictorious goddess at Pylos who crushed the peas herself.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh, Demos! the goddess watches over you; she is\\nstretching forth over your head ... a stew-pan full of broth.\\n\\nDEMOS. And should we still be dwelling in this city without this\\nprotecting stew-pan?\\n\\nCLEON. Here are some fish, given to you by her who is the terror of our\\nfoes.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The daughter of the mightiest of the gods sends you this\\nmeat cooked in its own gravy, along with this dish of tripe and some\\npaunch.\\n\\nDEMOS. \\'Tis to thank me for the Peplos I offered to her; \\'tis well.\\n\\nCLEON. The goddess with the terrible plume invites you to eat this long\\ncake; you will row the harder on it.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Take this also.\\n\\nDEMOS. And what shall I do with this tripe?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. She sends it you to belly out your galleys, for she is\\nalways showing her kindly anxiety for our fleet. Now drink this beverage\\ncomposed of three parts of water to two of wine.\\n\\nDEMOS. Ah! what delicious wine, and how well it stands the water.[129]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \\'Twas the goddess who came from the head of Zeus that\\nmixed this liquor with her own hands.\\n\\nCLEON. Hold, here is a piece of good rich cake.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But I offer you an entire cake.\\n\\nCLEON. But you cannot offer him stewed hare as I do.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! great gods! stewed hare! where shall I find it? Oh!\\nbrain of mine, devise some trick!\\n\\nCLEON. Do you see this, poor fellow?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. A fig for that! Here are folk coming to seek me.\\n\\nCLEON. Who are they?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Envoys, bearing sacks bulging with money.\\n\\nCLEON. (_Hearing money mentioned Clean turns his head, and Agoracritus\\nseizes the opportunity to snatch away the stewed hare._) Where, where, I\\nsay?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Bah! What\\'s that to you? Will you not even now let the\\nstrangers alone? Demos, do you see this stewed hare which I bring you?\\n\\nCLEON. Ah! rascal! you have shamelessly robbed me.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. You have robbed too, you robbed the Laconians at Pylos.\\n\\nDEMOS. An you pity me, tell me, how did you get the idea to filch it from\\nhim?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The idea comes from the goddess; the theft is all my own.\\n\\nCLEON. And I had taken such trouble to catch this hare.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But \\'twas I who had it cooked.\\n\\nDEMOS (_to Cleon_). Get you gone! My thanks are only for him who served\\nit.\\n\\nCLEON. Ah! wretch! have you beaten me in impudence!\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Well then, Demos, say now, who has treated you best, you\\nand your stomach? Decide!\\n\\nDEMOS. How shall I act here so that the spectators shall approve my\\njudgment?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will tell you. Without saying anything, go and rummage\\nthrough my basket, and then through the Paphlagonian\\'s, and see what is\\nin them; that\\'s the best way to judge.\\n\\nDEMOS. Let us see then, what is there in yours?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Why, \\'tis empty, dear little father; I have brought\\neverything to you.\\n\\nDEMOS. This is a basket devoted to the people.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Now hunt through the Paphlagonian\\'s. Well?\\n\\nDEMOS. Oh! what a lot of good things! Why! \\'tis quite full! Oh! what a\\nhuge great part of this cake he kept for himself! He had only cut off the\\nleast little tiny piece for me.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But this is what he has always done. Of everything he\\ntook, he only gave you the crumbs, and kept the bulk.\\n\\nDEMOS. Oh! rascal! was this the way you robbed me? And I was loading you\\nwith chaplets and gifts!\\n\\nCLEON. \\'Twas for the public weal I robbed.\\n\\nDEMOS (_to Cleon_). Give me back that crown;[130] I will give it to him.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Return it quick, quick, you gallows-bird.\\n\\nCLEON. No, for the Pythian oracle has revealed to me the name of him who\\nshall overthrow me.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And that name was mine, nothing can be clearer.\\n\\nCLEON. Reply and I shall soon see whether you are indeed the man whom the\\ngod intended. Firstly, what school did you attend when a child?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \\'Twas in the kitchens I was taught with cuffs and blows.\\n\\nCLEON. What\\'s that you say? Ah! this is truly what the oracle said. And\\nwhat did you learn from the master of exercises?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I learnt to take a false oath without a smile, when I had\\nstolen something.\\n\\nCLEON. Oh! Phoebus Apollo, god of Lycia! I am undone! And when you had\\nbecome a man, what trade did you follow?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I sold sausages and did a bit of fornication.\\n\\nCLEON. Oh! my god! I am a lost man! Ah! still one slender hope remains.\\nTell me, was it on the market-place or near the gates that you sold your\\nsausages?\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Near the gates, in the market for salted goods.\\n\\nCLEON Alas! I see the prophecy of the god is verily come true. Alas! roll\\nme home.[131] I am a miserable, ruined man. Farewell, my chaplet! \\'Tis\\ndeath to me to part with you. So you are to belong to another; \\'tis\\ncertain he cannot be a greater thief, but perhaps he may be a luckier\\none.[132]\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh! Zeus, the protector of Greece! \\'tis to you I owe this\\nvictory!\\n\\nDEMOSTHENES. Hail! illustrious conqueror, but forget not, that if you\\nhave become a great man, \\'tis thanks to me; I ask but a little thing;\\nappoint me secretary of the law-court in the room of Phanus.\\n\\nDEMOS (_to the Sausage-seller_). But what is your name then? Tell me.\\n\\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. My name is Agoracritus, because I have always lived on\\nthe market-place in the midst of lawsuits.[133]\\n\\nDEMOS. Well then, Agoracritus, I stand by you; as for the Paphlagonian, I\\nhand him over to your mercy.\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. Demos, I will care for you to the best of my power, and all\\nshall admit that no citizen is more devoted than I to this city of\\nsimpletons.\\n\\nCHORUS. What fitter theme for our Muse, at the close as at the beginning\\nof his work, than this, to sing the hero who drives his swift steeds down\\nthe arena? Why afflict Lysistratus with our satires on his poverty,[134]\\nand Thumantis,[135] who has not so much as a lodging? He is dying of\\nhunger and can be seen at Delphi, his face bathed in tears, clinging to\\nyour quiver, oh, Apollo! and supplicating you to take him out of his\\nmisery.\\n\\nAn insult directed at the wicked is not to be censured; on the contrary,\\nthe honest man, if he has sense, can only applaud. Him, whom I wish to\\nbrand with infamy, is little known himself; \\'tis the brother of\\nArignotus.[136] I regret to quote this name which is so dear to me, but\\nwhoever can distinguish black from white, or the Orthian mode of music\\nfrom others, knows the virtues of Arignotus, whom his brother,\\nAriphrades,[137] in no way resembles. He gloats in vice, is not merely a\\ndissolute man and utterly debauched--but he has actually invented a new\\nform of vice; for he pollutes his tongue with abominable pleasures in\\nbrothels licking up that nauseous moisture and befouling his beard as he\\ntickles the lips of lewd women\\'s private parts.[138] Whoever is not\\nhorrified at such a monster shall never drink from the same cup with me.\\n\\nAt times a thought weighs on me at night; I wonder whence comes this\\nfearful voracity of Cleonymus.[139] \\'Tis said, that when dining with a\\nrich host, he springs at the dishes with the gluttony of a wild beast and\\nnever leaves the bread-bin until his host seizes him round the knees,\\nexclaiming, \"Go, go, good gentleman, in mercy go, and spare my poor\\ntable!\"\\n\\n\\'Tis said that the triremes assembled in council and that the oldest\\nspoke in these terms, \"Are you ignorant, my sisters, of what is plotting\\nin Athens? They say, that a certain Hyperbolus,[140] a bad citizen and an\\ninfamous scoundrel, asks for a hundred of us to take them to sea against\\nChalcedon.\"[141] All were indignant, and one of them, as yet a virgin,\\ncried, \"May god forbid that I should ever obey him! I would prefer to\\ngrow old in the harbour and be gnawed by worms. No! by the gods I swear\\nit, Nauphanté, daughter of Nauson, shall never bend to his law; \\'tis as\\ntrue as I am made of wood and pitch. If the Athenians vote for the\\nproposal of Hyperbolus, let them! we will hoist full sail and seek refuge\\nby the temple of Theseus or the shrine of the Euminides.[142] No! he\\nshall not command us! No! he shall not play with the city to this extent!\\nLet him sail by himself for Tartarus, if such please him, launching the\\nboats in which he used to sell his lamps.\"\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. Maintain a holy silence! Keep your mouths from utterance!\\ncall no more witnesses; close these tribunals, which are the delight of\\nthis city, and gather at the theatre to chant the Paean of thanksgiving\\nto the gods for a fresh favour.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! torch of sacred Athens, saviour of the Islands, what good\\ntidings are we to celebrate by letting the blood of the victims flow in\\nour market-places?\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. I have freshened Demos up somewhat on the stove and have\\nturned his ugliness into beauty.\\n\\nCHORUS. I admire your inventive genius; but, where is he?\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. He is living in ancient Athens, the city of the garlands of\\nviolets.\\n\\nCHORUS. How I should like to see him! What is his dress like, what his\\nmanner?\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. He has once more become as he was in the days when he lived\\nwith Aristides and Miltiades. But you will judge for yourselves, for I\\nhear the vestibule doors opening. Hail with your shouts of gladness the\\nAthens of old, which now doth reappear to your gaze, admirable, worthy of\\nthe songs of the poets and the home of the illustrious Demos.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! noble, brilliant Athens, whose brow is wreathed with violets,\\nshow us the sovereign master of this land and of all Greece.\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. Lo! here he is coming with his hair held in place with a\\ngolden band and in all the glory of his old-world dress; perfumed with\\nmyrrh, he spreads around him not the odour of lawsuits, but of peace.\\n\\nCHORUS. Hail! King of Greece, we congratulate you upon the happiness you\\nenjoy; it is worthy of this city, worthy of the glory of Marathon.\\n\\nDEMOS. Come, Agoracritus, come, my best friend; see the service you have\\ndone me by freshening me up on your stove.\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. Ah! if you but remembered what you were formerly and what\\nyou did, you would for a certainty believe me to be a god.\\n\\nDEMOS. But what did I? and how was I then?\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. Firstly, so soon as ever an orator declared in the assembly\\n\"Demos, I love you ardently; \\'tis I alone, who dream of you and watch\\nover your interests\"; at such an exordium you would look like a cock\\nflapping his wings or a bull tossing his horns.\\n\\nDEMOS. What, I?\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. Then, after he had fooled you to the hilt, he would go.\\n\\nDEMOS. What! they would treat me so, and I never saw it!\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. You knew only how to open and close your ears like a\\nsunshade.\\n\\nDEMOS. Was I then so stupid and such a dotard?\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. Worse than that; if one of two orators proposed to equip a\\nfleet for war and the other suggested the use of the same sum for paying\\nout to the citizens, \\'twas the latter who always carried the day. Well!\\nyou droop your head! you turn away your face?\\n\\nDEMOS. I redden at my past errors.\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. Think no more of them; \\'tis not you who are to blame, but\\nthose who cheated you in this sorry fashion. But, come, if some impudent\\nlawyer dared to say, \"Dicasts, you shall have no wheat unless you convict\\nthis accused man!\" what would you do? Tell me.\\n\\nDEMOS. I would have him removed from the bar, I would bind Hyperbolus\\nabout his neck like a stone and would fling him into the Barathrum.[143]\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. Well spoken! but what other measures do you wish to take?\\n\\nDEMOS. First, as soon as ever a fleet returns to the harbour, I shall pay\\nup the rowers in full.\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. That will soothe many a worn and chafed bottom.\\n\\nDEMOS. Further, the hoplite enrolled for military service shall not get\\ntransferred to another service through favour, but shall stick to that\\ngiven him at the outset.\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. This will strike the buckler of Cleonymus full in the\\ncentre.\\n\\nDEMOS. None shall ascend the rostrum, unless their chins are bearded.\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. What then will become of Clisthenes and of Strato?[144]\\n\\nDEMOS. I wish only to refer to those youths, who loll about the perfume\\nshops, babbling at random, \"What a clever fellow is Pheax![145] How\\ncleverly he escaped death! how concise and convincing is his style! what\\nphrases! how clear and to the point! how well he knows how to quell an\\ninterruption!\"\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. I thought you were the lover of those pathic minions.\\n\\nDEMOS. The gods forefend it! and I will force all such fellows to go\\na-hunting instead of proposing decrees.\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. In that case, accept this folding-stool, and to carry it\\nthis well-grown, big-testicled slave lad. Besides, you may put him to any\\nother purpose you please.\\n\\nDEMOS. Oh! I am happy indeed to find myself as I was of old!\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. Aye, you deem yourself happy, when I shall have handed you\\nthe truces of thirty years. Truces! step forward![146]\\n\\nDEMOS. Great gods! how charming they are! Can I do with them as I wish?\\nwhere did you discover them, pray?\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. \\'Twas that Paphlagonian who kept them locked up in his\\nhouse, so that you might not enjoy them. As for myself, I give them to\\nyou; take them with you into the country.\\n\\nDEMOS. And what punishment will you inflict upon this Paphlagonian, the\\ncause of all my troubles?\\n\\nAGORACRITUS. \\'Twill not be over-terrible. I condemn him to follow my old\\ntrade; posted near the gates, he must sell sausages of asses\\' and\\ndogs\\'-meat; perpetually drunk, he will exchange foul language with\\nprostitutes and will drink nothing but the dirty water from the baths.\\n\\nDEMOS. Well conceived! he is indeed fit to wrangle with harlots and\\nbathmen; as for you, in return for so many blessings, I invite you to\\ntake the place at the Prytaneum which this rogue once occupied. Put on\\nthis frog-green mantle and follow me. As for the other, let \\'em take him\\naway; let him go sell his sausages in full view of the foreigners, whom\\nhe used formerly so wantonly to insult.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFINIS OF \"THE KNIGHTS\"', 'in the country.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTHE ACHARNIANS\\n\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS[147] (_alone_). What cares have not gnawed at my heart and\\nhow few have been the pleasures in my life! Four, to be exact, while my\\ntroubles have been as countless as the grains of sand on the shore! Let\\nme see of what value to me have been these few pleasures? Ah! I remember\\nthat I was delighted in soul when Cleon had to disgorge those five\\ntalents;[148] I was in ecstasy and I love the Knights for this deed; \\'it\\nis an honour to Greece.\\'[149] But the day when I was impatiently awaiting\\na piece by Aeschylus,[150] what tragic despair it caused me when the\\nherald called, \"Theognis,[151] introduce your Chorus!\" Just imagine how\\nthis blow struck straight at my heart! On the other hand, what joy\\nDexitheus caused me at the musical competition, when he played a Boeotian\\nmelody on the lyre! But this year by contrast! Oh! what deadly torture to\\nhear Chaeris[152] perform the prelude in the Orthian mode![153]--Never,\\nhowever, since I began to bathe, has the dust hurt my eyes as it does\\nto-day. Still it is the day of assembly; all should be here at daybreak,\\nand yet the Pnyx[154] is still deserted. They are gossiping in the\\nmarket-place, slipping hither and thither to avoid the vermilioned\\nrope.[155] The Prytanes[156] even do not come; they will be late, but\\nwhen they come they will push and fight each other for a seat in the\\nfront row. They will never trouble themselves with the question of peace.\\nOh! Athens! Athens! As for myself, I do not fail to come here before all\\nthe rest, and now, finding myself alone, I groan, yawn, stretch, break\\nwind, and know not what to do; I make sketches in the dust, pull out my\\nloose hairs, muse, think of my fields, long for peace, curse town life\\nand regret my dear country home,[157] which never told me to \\'buy fuel,\\nvinegar or oil\\'; there the word \\'buy,\\' which cuts me in two, was unknown;\\nI harvested everything at will. Therefore I have come to the assembly\\nfully prepared to bawl, interrupt and abuse the speakers, if they talk of\\naught but peace. But here come the Prytanes, and high time too, for it is\\nmidday! As I foretold, hah! is it not so? They are pushing and fighting\\nfor the front seats.\\n\\nHERALD. Move on up, move on, move on, to get within the consecrated\\narea.[158]\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. Has anyone spoken yet?\\n\\nHERALD. Who asks to speak?\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. I do.\\n\\nHERALD. Your name?\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. Amphitheus.\\n\\nHERALD. You are no man.[159]\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. No! I am an immortal! Amphitheus was the son of Ceres and\\nTriptolemus; of him was born Celeus. Celeus wedded Phaencreté, my\\ngrandmother, whose son was Lucinus, and, being born of him, I am an\\nimmortal; it is to me alone that the gods have entrusted the duty of\\ntreating with the Lacedaemonians. But, citizens, though I am immortal, I\\nam dying of hunger; the Prytanes give me naught.[160]\\n\\nA PRYTANIS. Guards!\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. Oh, Triptolemus and Ceres, do ye thus forsake your own blood?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Prytanes, in expelling this citizen, you are offering an\\noutrage to the Assembly. He only desired to secure peace for us and to\\nsheathe the sword.\\n\\nPRYTANIS. Sit down and keep silence!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, by Apollo, will I not, unless you are going to discuss\\nthe question of peace.\\n\\nHERALD. The ambassadors, who are returned from the Court of the King!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Of what King? I am sick of all those fine birds, the peacock\\nambassadors and their swagger.\\n\\nHERALD. Silence!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! oh! by Ecbatana,[161] what assumption!\\n\\nAN AMBASSADOR. During the archonship of Euthymenes, you sent us to the\\nGreat King on a salary of two drachmae per diem.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! those poor drachmae!\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. We suffered horribly on the plains of the Caÿster, sleeping\\nunder a tent, stretched deliciously on fine chariots, half dead with\\nweariness.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And I was very much at ease, lying on the straw along the\\nbattlements![162]\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. Everywhere we were well received and forced to drink\\ndelicious wine out of golden or crystal flagons....\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, city of Cranaus,[163] thy ambassadors are laughing at\\nthee!\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. For great feeders and heavy drinkers are alone esteemed as\\nmen by the barbarians.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Just as here in Athens, we only esteem the most drunken\\ndebauchees.\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. At the end of the fourth year we reached the King\\'s Court,\\nbut he had left with his whole army to ease himself, and for the space of\\neight months he was thus easing himself in midst of the golden\\nmountains.[164]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And how long was he replacing his dress?\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. The whole period of a full moon; after which he returned to\\nhis palace; then he entertained us and had us served with oxen roasted\\nwhole in an oven.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Who ever saw an oxen baked in an oven? What a lie!\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. On my honour, he also had us served with a bird three times\\nas large as Cleonymus,[165] and called the Boaster.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And do we give you two drachmae, that you should treat us to\\nall this humbug?\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. We are bringing to you, Pseudartabas,[166] the King\\'s Eye.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. I would a crow might pluck out thine with his beak, thou\\ncursed ambassador!\\n\\nHERALD. The King\\'s Eye!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Eh! Great gods! Friend, with thy great eye, round like the\\nhole through which the oarsman passes his sweep, you have the air of a\\ngalley doubling a cape to gain the port.\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. Come, Pseudartabas, give forth the message for the Athenians\\nwith which you were charged by the Great King.\\n\\nPSEUDARTABAS. Jartaman exarx \\'anapissonnai satra.[167]\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. Do you understand what he says?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. By Apollo, not I!\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. He says, that the Great King will send you gold. Come, utter\\nthe word \\'gold\\' louder and more distinctly.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Thou shalt not have gold, thou gaping-arsed Ionian.[168]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! may the gods forgive me, but that is clear enough.\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. What does he say?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. That the Ionians are debauchees and idiots, if they expect\\nto receive gold from the barbarians.\\n\\nAMBASSADOR. Not so, he speaks of medimni[169] of gold.\\n\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What medimni? Thou art but a great braggart; but get your\\nway, I will find out the truth by myself. Come now, answer me clearly, if\\nyou do not wish me to dye your skin red. Will the Great King send us\\ngold? (_Pseudartabas makes a negative sign._) Then our ambassadors are\\nseeking to deceive us? (_Pseudartabas signs affirmatively._) These\\nfellows make signs like any Greek; I am sure that they are nothing but\\nAthenians. Oh, ho! I recognize one of these eunuchs; it is Clisthenes,\\nthe son of Sibyrtius.[170] Behold the effrontery of this shaven rump!\\nHow! great baboon, with such a beard do you seek to play the eunuch to\\nus? And this other one? Is it not Straton?\\n\\nHERALD. Silence! Let all be seated. The Senate invites the King\\'s Eye to\\nthe Prytaneum.[171]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Is this not sufficient to drive one to hang oneself? Here I\\nstand chilled to the bone, whilst the doors of the Prytaneum fly wide\\nopen to lodge such rascals. But I will do something great and bold. Where\\nis Amphitheus? Come and speak with me.\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. Here I am.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Take these eight drachmae and go and conclude a truce with\\nthe Lacedaemonians for me, my wife and my children; I leave you free, my\\ndear citizens, to send out embassies and to stand gaping in the air.\\n\\nHERALD. Bring in Theorus, who has returned from the Court of\\nSitalces.[172]\\n\\nTHEORUS. I am here.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Another humbug!\\n\\nTHEORUS. We should not have remained long in Thrace....\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Forsooth, no, if you had not been well paid.\\n\\nTHEORUS. ... If the country had not been covered with snow; the rivers\\nwere ice-bound at the time that Theognis[173] brought out his tragedy\\nhere; during the whole of that time I was holding my own with Sitalces,\\ncup in hand; and, in truth, he adored you to such a degree, that he wrote\\non the walls, \"How beautiful are the Athenians!\" His son, to whom we gave\\nthe freedom of the city, burned with desire to come here and eat\\nchitterlings at the feast of the Apaturia;[174] he prayed his father to\\ncome to the aid of his new country and Sitalces swore on his goblet that\\nhe would succour us with such a host that the Athenians would exclaim,\\n\"What a cloud of grasshoppers!\"\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. May I die if I believe a word of what you tell us! Excepting\\nthe grasshoppers, there is not a grain of truth in it all!\\n\\nTHEORUS. And he has sent you the most warlike soldiers of all Thrace.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Now we shall begin to see clearly.\\n\\nHERALD. Come hither, Thracians, whom Theorus brought.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What plague have we here?\\n\\nTHEORUS. \\'Tis the host of the Odomanti.[175]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Of the Odomanti? Tell me what it means. Who has mutilated\\ntheir tools like this?\\n\\nTHEORUS. If they are given a wage of two drachmae, they will put all\\nBoeotia[176] to fire and sword.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Two drachmae to those circumcised hounds! Groan aloud, ye\\npeople of rowers, bulwark of Athens! Ah! great gods! I am undone; these\\nOdomanti are robbing me of my garlic![177] Will you give me back my\\ngarlic?\\n\\nTHEORUS. Oh! wretched man! do not go near them; they have eaten\\ngarlic.[178]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Prytanes, will you let me be treated in this manner, in my\\nown country and by barbarians? But I oppose the discussion of paying a\\nwage to the Thracians; I announce an omen; I have just felt a drop of\\nrain.[179]\\n\\nHERALD. Let the Thracians withdraw and return the day after to-morrow;\\nthe Prytanes declare the sitting at an end.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ye gods, what garlic I have lost! But here comes Amphitheus\\nreturned from Lacedaemon. Welcome, Amphitheus.\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. No, there is no welcome for me and I fly as fast as I can,\\nfor I am pursued by the Acharnians.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Why, what has happened?\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. I was hurrying to bring your treaty of truce, but some old\\ndotards from Acharnae[180] got scent of the thing; they are veterans of\\nMarathon, tough as oak or maple, of which they are made for sure--rough\\nand ruthless. They all set to a-crying, \"Wretch! you are the bearer of a\\ntreaty, and the enemy has only just cut our vines!\" Meanwhile they were\\ngathering stones in their cloaks, so I fled and they ran after me\\nshouting.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Let \\'em shout as much as they please! But have you brought\\nme a treaty?\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. Most certainly, here are three samples to select from,[181]\\nthis one is five years old; take it and taste.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Faugh!\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. Well?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. It does not please me; it smells of pitch and of the ships\\nthey are fitting out.[182]\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. Here is another, ten years old; taste it.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. It smells strongly of the delegates, who go round the towns\\nto chide the allies for their slowness.[183]\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. This last is a truce of thirty years, both on sea and land.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! by Bacchus! what a bouquet! It has the aroma of nectar\\nand ambrosia; this does not say to us, \"Provision yourselves for three\\ndays.\" But it lisps the gentle numbers, \"Go whither you will.\"[184] I\\naccept it, ratify it, drink it at one draught and consign the Acharnians\\nto limbo. Freed from the war and its ills, I shall keep the Dionysia[185]\\nin the country.\\n\\nAMPHITHEUS. And I shall run away, for I\\'m mortally afraid of the\\nAcharnians.\\n\\nCHORUS. This way all! Let us follow our man; we will demand him of\\neveryone we meet; the public weal makes his seizure imperative. Ho,\\nthere! tell me which way the bearer of the truce has gone; he has escaped\\nus, he has disappeared. Curse old age! When I was young, in the days when\\nI followed Phayllus,[186] running with a sack of coals on my back, this\\nwretch would not have eluded my pursuit, let him be as swift as he will;\\nbut now my limbs are stiff; old Lacratides[187] feels his legs are\\nweighty and the traitor escapes me. No, no, let us follow him; old\\nAcharnians like ourselves shall not be set at naught by a scoundrel, who\\nhas dared, great gods! to conclude a truce, when I wanted the war\\ncontinued with double fury in order to avenge my ruined lands. No mercy\\nfor our foes until I have pierced their hearts like a sharp reed, so that\\nthey dare never again ravage my vineyards. Come, let us seek the rascal;\\nlet us look everywhere, carrying our stones in our hands; let us hunt him\\nfrom place to place until we trap him; I could never, never tire of the\\ndelight of stoning him.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Peace! profane men![188]\\n\\nCHORUS. Silence all! Friends, do you hear the sacred formula? Here is he,\\nwhom we seek! This way, all! Get out of his way, surely he comes to offer\\nan oblation.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Peace, profane men! Let the basket-bearer[189] come forward,\\nand thou, Xanthias, hold the phallus well upright.[190]\\n\\nWIFE OF DICAEOPOLIS. Daughter, set down the basket and let us begin the\\nsacrifice.\\n\\nDAUGHTER OF DICAEOPOLIS. Mother, hand me the ladle, that I may spread the\\nsauce on the cake.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. It is well! Oh, mighty Bacchus, it is with joy that, freed\\nfrom military duty, I and all mine perform this solemn rite and offer\\nthee this sacrifice; grant, that I may keep the rural Dionysia without\\nhindrance and that this truce of thirty years may be propitious for me.\\n\\nWIFE OF DICAEOPOLIS. Come, my child, carry the basket gracefully and with\\na grave, demure face. Happy he, who shall be your possessor and embrace\\nyou so firmly at dawn,[191] that you belch wind like a weasel. Go\\nforward, and have a care they don\\'t snatch your jewels in the crowd.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Xanthias, walk behind the basket-bearer and hold the phallus\\nwell erect; I will follow, singing the Phallic hymn; thou, wife, look on\\nfrom the top of the terrace.[192] Forward! Oh, Phales,[193] companion of\\nthe orgies of Bacchus, night reveller, god of adultery, friend of young\\nmen, these past six[194] years I have not been able to invoke thee. With\\nwhat joy I return to my farmstead, thanks to the truce I have concluded,\\nfreed from cares, from fighting and from Lamachuses![195] How much\\nsweeter, Phales, oh, Phales, is it to surprise Thratta, the pretty\\nwood-maid, Strymodorus\\' slave, stealing wood from Mount Phelleus, to\\ncatch her under the arms, to throw her on the ground and possess her! Oh,\\nPhales, Phales! If thou wilt drink and bemuse thyself with me, we will\\nto-morrow consume some good dish in honour of the peace, and I will hang\\nup my buckler over the smoking hearth.\\n\\nCHORUS. It is he, he himself. Stone him, stone him, stone him, strike the\\nwretch. All, all of you, pelt him, pelt him!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What is this? By Heracles, you will smash my pot.[196]\\n\\nCHORUS. It is you that we are stoning, you miserable scoundrel.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And for what sin, Acharnian Elders, tell me that!\\n\\nCHORUS. You ask that, you impudent rascal, traitor to your country; you\\nalone amongst us all have concluded a truce, and you dare to look us in\\nthe face!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. But you do not know _why_ I have treated for peace. Listen!\\n\\nCHORUS. Listen to you? No, no, you are about to die, we will annihilate\\nyou with our stones.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. But first of all, listen. Stop, my friends.\\n\\nCHORUS. I will hear nothing; do not address me; I hate you more than I do\\nCleon,[197] whom one day I shall flay to make sandals for the Knights.\\nListen to your long speeches, after you have treated with the Laconians!\\nNo, I will punish you.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Friends, leave the Laconians out of debate and consider only\\nwhether I have not done well to conclude my truce.\\n\\nCHORUS. Done well! when you have treated with a people who know neither\\ngods, nor truth, nor faith.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. We attribute too much to the Laconians; as for myself, I\\nknow that they are not the cause of all our troubles.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh, indeed, rascal! You dare to use such language to me and then\\nexpect me to spare you!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, no, they are not the cause of all our troubles, and I\\nwho address you claim to be able to prove that they have much to complain\\nof in us.\\n\\nCHORUS. This passes endurance; my heart bounds with fury. Thus you dare\\nto defend our enemies.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Were my head on the block I would uphold what I say and rely\\non the approval of the people.\\n\\nCHORUS. Comrades, let us hurl our stones and dye this fellow purple.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What black fire-brand has inflamed your heart! You will not\\nhear me? You really will not, Acharnians?\\n\\nCHORUS. No, a thousand times, no.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. This is a hateful injustice.\\n\\nCHORUS. May I die, if I listen.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Nay, nay! have mercy, have mercy, Acharnians.\\n\\nCHORUS. You shall die.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Well, blood for blood! I will kill your dearest friend. I\\nhave here the hostages of Acharnae;[198] I shall disembowel them.\\n\\nCHORUS. Acharnians, what means this threat? Has he got one of our\\nchildren in his house? What gives him such audacity?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Stone me, if it please you; I shall avenge myself on this.\\n(_Shows a basket_.) Let us see whether you have any love for your coals.\\n\\nCHORUS. Great gods! this basket is our fellow-citizen. Stop, stop, in\\nheaven\\'s name!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. I shall dismember it despite your cries; I will listen to\\nnothing.\\n\\nCHORUS. How! will you kill this coal-basket, my beloved comrade?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Just now, you did not listen to me.\\n\\nCHORUS. Well, speak now, if you will; tell us, tell us you have a\\nweakness for the Lacedaemonians. I consent to anything; never will I\\nforsake this dear little basket.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. First, throw down your stones.\\n\\nCHORUS. There! \\'tis done. And you, do you put away your sword.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Let me see that no stones remain concealed in your cloaks.\\n\\nCHORUS. They are all on the ground; see how we shake our garments. Come,\\nno haggling, lay down your sword; we threw away everything while crossing\\nfrom one side of the stage to the other.[199]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What cries of anguish you would have uttered had these coals\\nof Parnes[200] been dismembered, and yet it came very near it; had they\\nperished, their death would have been due to the folly of their\\nfellow-citizens. The poor basket was so frightened, look, it has shed a\\nthick black dust over me, the same as a cuttle-fish does. What an\\nirritable temper! You shout and throw stones, you will not hear my\\narguments--not even when I propose to speak in favour of the\\nLacedaemonians with my head on the block; and yet I cling to my life.\\n\\nCHORUS. Well then, bring out a block before your door, scoundrel, and let\\nus hear the good grounds you can give us; I am curious to know them. Now\\nmind, as you proposed yourself, place your head on the block and speak.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Here is the block; and, though I am but a very sorry\\nspeaker, I wish nevertheless to talk freely of the Lacedaemonians and\\nwithout the protection of my buckler. Yet I have many reasons for fear. I\\nknow our rustics; they are delighted if some braggart comes, and rightly\\nor wrongly loads both them and their city with praise and flattery; they\\ndo not see that such toad-eaters[201] are traitors, who sell them for\\ngain. As for the old men, I know their weakness; they only seek to\\noverwhelm the accused with their votes.[202] Nor have I forgotten how\\nCleon treated me because of my comedy last year;[203] he dragged me\\nbefore the Senate and there he uttered endless slanders against me; \\'twas\\na tempest of abuse, a deluge of lies. Through what a slough of mud he\\ndragged me! I nigh perished. Permit me, therefore, before I speak, to\\ndress in the manner most likely to draw pity.\\n\\nCHORUS. What evasions, subterfuges and delays! Hold! here is the sombre\\nhelmet of Pluto with its thick bristling plume; Hieronymus[204] lends it\\nto you; then open Sisyphus\\'[205] bag of wiles; but hurry, hurry, pray,\\nfor our discussion does not admit of delay.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. The time has come for me to manifest my courage, so I will\\ngo and seek Euripides. Ho! slave, slave!\\n\\nSLAVE. Who\\'s there?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Is Euripides at home?\\n\\nSLAVE. He is and he isn\\'t; understand that, if you have wit for\\'t.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. How? He is and he isn\\'t![206]\\n\\nSLAVE. Certainly, old man; busy gathering subtle fancies here and there,\\nhis mind is not in the house, but he himself is; perched aloft, he is\\ncomposing a tragedy.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, Euripides, you are indeed happy to have a slave so quick\\nat repartee! Now, fellow, call your master.\\n\\nSLAVE. Impossible!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. So much the worse. But I will not go. Come, let us knock at\\nthe door. Euripides, my little Euripides, my darling Euripides, listen;\\nnever had man greater right to your pity. It is Dicaeopolis of the\\nChollidan Deme who calls you. Do you hear?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I have no time to waste.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Very well, have yourself wheeled out here.[207]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Impossible.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Nevertheless....\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Well, let them roll me out; as to coming down, I have not the\\ntime.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Euripides....\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What words strike my ear?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. You perch aloft to compose tragedies, when you might just as\\nwell do them on the ground. I am not astonished at your introducing\\ncripples on the stage.[208] And why dress in these miserable tragic rags?\\nI do not wonder that your heroes are beggars. But, Euripides, on my knees\\nI beseech you, give me the tatters of some old piece: for I have to treat\\nthe Chorus to a long speech, and if I do it ill it is all over with me.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What rags do you prefer? Those in which I rigged out\\nAeneus[209] on the stage, that unhappy, miserable old man?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, I want those of some hero still more unfortunate.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Of Phoenix, the blind man?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, not of Phoenix, you have another hero more unfortunate\\nthan him.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Now, what tatters _does_ he want? Do you mean those of the\\nbeggar Philoctetes?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, of another far more the mendicant.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Is it the filthy dress of the lame fellow, Bellerophon?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, \\'tis not Bellerophon; he, whom I mean, was not only lame\\nand a beggar, but boastful and a fine speaker.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Ah! I know, it is Telephus, the Mysian.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Yes, Telephus. Give me his rags, I beg of you.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Slave! give him Telephus\\' tatters; they are on top of the rags\\nof Thyestes and mixed with those of Ino.\\n\\nSLAVE. Catch hold! here they are.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! Zeus, whose eye pierces everywhere and embraces all,\\npermit me to assume the most wretched dress on earth. Euripides, cap your\\nkindness by giving me the little Mysian hat, that goes so well with these\\ntatters. I must to-day have the look of a beggar; \"be what I am, but not\\nappear to be\";[210] the audience will know well who I am, but the Chorus\\nwill be fools enough not to, and I shall dupe \\'em with my subtle phrases.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I will give you the hat; I love the clever tricks of an\\ningenious brain like yours.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Rest happy, and may it befall Telephus as I wish. Ah! I\\nalready feel myself filled with quibbles. But I must have a beggar\\'s\\nstaff.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Here you are, and now get you gone from this porch.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, my soul! You see how you are driven from this house,\\nwhen I still need so many accessories. But let us be pressing, obstinate,\\nimportunate. Euripides, give me a little basket with a lamp alight\\ninside.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Whatever do you want such a thing as that for?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. I do not need it, but I want it all the same.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You importune me; get you gone!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Alas! may the gods grant you a destiny as brilliant as your\\nmother\\'s.[211]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Leave me in peace.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! just a little broken cup.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Take it and go and hang yourself. What a tiresome fellow!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! you do not know all the pain you cause me. Dear, good\\nEuripides, nothing beyond a small pipkin stoppered with a sponge.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Miserable man! You are robbing me of an entire tragedy.[212]\\nHere, take it and be off.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. I am going, but, great gods! I need one thing more; unless I\\nhave it, I am a dead man. Hearken, my little Euripides, only give me this\\nand I go, never to return. For pity\\'s sake, do give me a few small herbs\\nfor my basket.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You wish to ruin me then. Here, take what you want; but it is\\nall over with my pieces!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. I won\\'t ask another thing; I\\'m going. I am too importunate\\nand forget that I rouse against me the hate of kings.--Ah! wretch that I\\nam! I am lost! I have forgotten one thing, without which all the rest is\\nas nothing. Euripides, my excellent Euripides, my dear little Euripides,\\nmay I die if I ask you again for the smallest present; only one, the\\nlast, absolutely the last; give me some of the chervil your mother left\\nyou in her will.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Insolent hound! Slave, lock the door.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, my soul! I must go away without the chervil. Art thou\\nsensible of the dangerous battle we are about to engage upon in defending\\nthe Lacedaemonians? Courage, my soul, we must plunge into the midst of\\nit. Dost thou hesitate and art thou fully steeped in Euripides? That\\'s\\nright! do not falter, my poor heart, and let us risk our head to say what\\nwe hold for truth. Courage and boldly to the front. I wonder I am so\\nbrave!\\n\\nCHORUS. What do you purport doing? what are you going to say? What an\\nimpudent fellow! what a brazen heart! To dare to stake his head and\\nuphold an opinion contrary to that of us all! And he does not tremble to\\nface this peril! Come, it is you who desired it, speak!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Spectators, be not angered if, although I am a beggar, I\\ndare in a Comedy to speak before the people of Athens of the public weal;\\nComedy too can sometimes discern what is right. I shall not please, but I\\nshall say what is true. Besides, Cleon shall not be able to accuse me of\\nattacking Athens before strangers;[213] we are by ourselves at the\\nfestival of the Lenaea; the period when our allies send us their tribute\\nand their soldiers is not yet. Here is only the pure wheat without chaff;\\nas to the resident strangers settled among us, they and the citizens are\\none, like the straw and the ear.\\n\\nI detest the Lacedaemonians with all my heart, and may Posidon, the god\\nof Taenarus,[214] cause an earthquake and overturn their dwellings! My\\nvines also have been cut. But come (there are only friends who hear me),\\nwhy accuse the Laconians of all our woes? Some men (I do not say the\\ncity, note particularly, that I do not say the city), some wretches, lost\\nin vices, bereft of honour, who were not even citizens of good stamp, but\\nstrangers, have accused the Megarians of introducing their produce\\nfraudulently, and not a cucumber, a leveret, a sucking-pig, a clove of\\ngarlic, a lump of salt was seen without its being said, \"Halloa! these\\ncome from Megara,\" and their being instantly confiscated. Thus far the\\nevil was not serious, and we were the only sufferers. But now some young\\ndrunkards go to Megara and carry off the courtesan Simaetha; the\\nMegarians, hurt to the quick, run off in turn with two harlots of the\\nhouse of Aspasia; and so for three gay women Greece is set ablaze. Then\\nPericles, aflame with ire on his Olympian height, let loose the\\nlightning, caused the thunder to roll, upset Greece and passed an edict,\\nwhich ran like the song, \"That the Megarians be banished both from our\\nland and from our markets and from the sea and from the continent.\"[215]\\nMeanwhile the Megarians, who were beginning to die of hunger, begged the\\nLacedaemonians to bring about the abolition of the decree, of which those\\nharlots were the cause; several times we refused their demand; and from\\nthat time there was a horrible clatter of arms everywhere. You will say\\nthat Sparta was wrong, but what should she have done? Answer that.\\nSuppose that a Lacedaemonian had seized a little Seriphian[216] dog on\\nany pretext and had sold it, would you have endured it quietly? Far from\\nit, you would at once have sent three hundred vessels to sea, and what an\\nuproar there would have been through all the city! there \\'tis a band of\\nnoisy soldiery, here a brawl about the election of a Trierarch; elsewhere\\npay is being distributed, the Pallas figure-heads are being regilded,\\ncrowds are surging under the market porticos, encumbered with wheat that\\nis being measured, wine-skins, oar-leathers, garlic, olives, onions in\\nnets; everywhere are chaplets, sprats, flute-girls, black eyes; in the\\narsenal bolts are being noisily driven home, sweeps are being made and\\nfitted with leathers; we hear nothing but the sound of whistles, of\\nflutes and fifes to encourage the work-folk. That is what you assuredly\\nwould have done, and would not Telephus have done the same? So I come to\\nmy general conclusion; we have no common sense.\\n\\nFIRST SEMI-CHORUS. Oh! wretch! oh! infamous man! You are naught but a\\nbeggar and yet you dare to talk to us like this! you insult their\\nworships the informers!\\n\\nSECOND SEMI-CHORUS. By Posidon! he speaks the truth; he has not lied in a\\nsingle detail.\\n\\nFIRST SEMI-CHORUS. But though it be true, need he say it? But you\\'ll have\\nno great cause to be proud of your insolence!\\n\\nSECOND SEMI-CHORUS. Where are you running to? Don\\'t you move; if you\\nstrike this man I shall be at you.\\n\\nFIRST SEMI-CHORUS. Lamachus, whose glance flashes lightning, whose plume\\npetrifies thy foes, help! Oh! Lamachus, my friend, the hero of my tribe\\nand all of you, both officers and soldiers, defenders of our walls, come\\nto my aid; else is it all over with me!\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Whence comes this cry of battle? where must I bring my aid?\\nwhere must I sow dread? who wants me to uncase my dreadful Gorgon\\'s\\nhead?[217]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, Lamachus, great hero! Your plumes and your cohorts\\nterrify me.\\n\\nCHORUS. This man, Lamachus, incessantly abuses Athens.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. You are but a mendicant and you dare to use language of this\\nsort?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, brave Lamachus, forgive a beggar who speaks at hazard.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. But what have you said? Let us hear.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. I know nothing about it; the sight of weapons makes me\\ndizzy. Oh! I adjure you, take that fearful Gorgon somewhat farther away.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. There.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Now place it face downwards on the ground.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. It is done.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Give me a plume out of your helmet.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Here is a feather.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And hold my head while I vomit; the plumes have turned my\\nstomach.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Hah! what are you proposing to do? do you want to make yourself\\nvomit with this feather?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Is it a feather? what bird\\'s? a braggart\\'s?\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Ah! ah! I will rip you open.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, no, Lamachus! Violence is out of place here! But as you\\nare so strong, why did you not circumcise me? You have all you want for\\nthe operation there.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. A beggar dares thus address a general!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. How? Am I a beggar?\\n\\nLAMACHUS. What are you then?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Who am I? A good citizen, not ambitious; a soldier, who has\\nfought well since the outbreak of the war, whereas you are but a vile\\nmercenary.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. They elected me....\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Yes, three cuckoos did![218] If I have concluded peace,\\n\\'twas disgust that drove me; for I see men with hoary heads in the ranks\\nand young fellows of your age shirking service. Some are in Thrace\\ngetting an allowance of three drachmae, such fellows as Tisameophoenippus\\nand Panurgipparchides. The others are with Chares or in Chaonia, men like\\nGeretotheodorus and Diomialazon; there are some of the same kidney, too,\\nat Camarina and at Gela,[219] the laughing-stock of all and sundry.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. They were elected.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And why do you always receive your pay, when none of these\\nothers ever get any? Speak, Marilades, you have grey hair; well then,\\nhave you ever been entrusted with a mission? See! he shakes his head. Yet\\nhe is an active as well as a prudent man. And you, Dracyllus, Euphorides\\nor Prinides, have you knowledge of Ecbatana or Chaonia? You say no, do\\nyou not? Such offices are good for the son of Caesyra[220] and Lamachus,\\nwho, but yesterday ruined with debt, never pay their shot, and whom all\\ntheir friends avoid as foot passengers dodge the folks who empty their\\nslops out of window.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Oh! in freedom\\'s name! are such exaggerations to be borne?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Lamachus is well content; no doubt he is well paid, you\\nknow.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. But I propose always to war with the Peloponnesians, both at\\nsea, on land and everywhere to make them tremble, and trounce them\\nsoundly.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. For my own part, I make proclamation to all Peloponnesians,\\nMegarians and Boeotians, that to them my markets are open; but I debar\\nLamachus from entering them.\\n\\nCHORUS. Convinced by this man\\'s speech, the folk have changed their view\\nand approve him for having concluded peace. But let us prepare for the\\nrecital of the parabasis.[221]\\n\\nNever since our poet presented Comedies, has he praised himself upon the\\nstage; but, having been slandered by his enemies amongst the volatile\\nAthenians, accused of scoffing at his country and of insulting the\\npeople, to-day he wishes to reply and regain for himself the inconstant\\nAthenians. He maintains that he has done much that is good for you; if\\nyou no longer allow yourselves to be too much hoodwinked by strangers or\\nseduced by flattery, if in politics you are no longer the ninnies you\\nonce were, it is thanks to him. Formerly, when delegates from other\\ncities wanted to deceive you, they had but to style you, \"the people\\ncrowned with violets,\" and, at the word \"violets\" you at once sat erect\\non the tips of your bums. Or, if to tickle your vanity, someone spoke of\\n\"rich and sleek Athens,\" in return for that \\'sleekness\\' he would get all,\\nbecause he spoke of you as he would have of anchovies in oil. In\\ncautioning you against such wiles, the poet has done you great service as\\nwell as in forcing you to understand what is really the democratic\\nprinciple. Thus, the strangers, who came to pay their tributes, wanted to\\nsee this great poet, who had dared to speak the truth to Athens. And so\\nfar has the fame of his boldness reached that one day the Great King,\\nwhen questioning the Lacedaemonian delegates, first asked them which of\\nthe two rival cities was the superior at sea, and then immediately\\ndemanded at which it was that the comic poet directed his biting satire.\\n\"Happy that city,\" he added, \"if it listens to his counsel; it will grow\\nin power, and its victory is assured.\" This is why the Lacedaemonians\\noffer you peace, if you will cede them Aegina; not that they care for the\\nisle, but they wish to rob you of your poet.[222] As for you, never lose\\nhim, who will always fight for the cause of justice in his Comedies; he\\npromises you that his precepts will lead you to happiness, though he uses\\nneither flattery, nor bribery, nor intrigue, nor deceit; instead of\\nloading you with praise, he will point you to the better way. I scoff at\\nCleon\\'s tricks and plotting; honesty and justice shall fight my cause;\\nnever will you find me a political poltroon, a prostitute to the highest\\nbidder.\\n\\nI invoke thee, Acharnian Muse, fierce and fell as the devouring fire;\\nsudden as the spark that bursts from the crackling oaken coal when roused\\nby the quickening fan to fry little fishes, while others knead the dough\\nor whip the sharp Thasian pickle with rapid hand, so break forth, my\\nMuse, and inspire thy tribesmen with rough, vigorous, stirring strains.\\n\\nWe others, now old men and heavy with years, we reproach the city; so\\nmany are the victories we have gained for the Athenian fleets that we\\nwell deserve to be cared for in our declining life; yet far from this, we\\nare ill-used, harassed with law-suits, delivered over to the scorn of\\nstripling orators. Our minds and bodies being ravaged with age, Posidon\\nshould protect us, yet we have no other support than a staff. When\\nstanding before the judge, we can scarcely stammer forth the fewest\\nwords, and of justice we see but its barest shadow, whereas the accuser,\\ndesirous of conciliating the younger men, overwhelms us with his ready\\nrhetoric; he drags us before the judge, presses us with questions, lays\\ntraps for us; the onslaught troubles, upsets and rends poor old Tithonus,\\nwho, crushed with age, stands tongue-tied; sentenced to a fine,[223] he\\nweeps, he sobs and says to his friend, \"This fine robs me of the last\\ntrifle that was to have bought my coffin.\"\\n\\nIs this not a scandal? What! the clepsydra[224] is to kill the\\nwhite-haired veteran, who, in fierce fighting, has so oft covered himself\\nwith glorious sweat, whose valour at Marathon saved the country! \\'Twas we\\nwho pursued on the field of Marathon, whereas now \\'tis wretches who\\npursue us to the death and crush us! What would Marpsias reply to\\nthis?[225] What an injustice, that a man, bent with age like Thucydides,\\nshould be brow-beaten by this braggart advocate, Cephisodemus,[226] who\\nis as savage as the Scythian desert he was born in! Is it not to convict\\nhim from the outset? I wept tears of pity when I saw an Archer[227]\\nmaltreat this old man, who, by Ceres, when he was young and the true\\nThucydides, would not have permitted an insult from Ceres herself! At\\nthat date he would have floored ten miserable orators, he would have\\nterrified three thousand Archers with his shouts; he would have pierced\\nthe whole line of the enemy with his shafts. Ah! but if you will not\\nleave the aged in peace, decree that the advocates be matched; thus the\\nold man will only be confronted with a toothless greybeard, the young\\nwill fight with the braggart, the ignoble with the son of Clinias[228];\\nmake a law that in future, the old man can only be summoned and convicted\\nat the courts by the aged and the young man by the youth.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. These are the confines of my market-place. All\\nPeloponnesians, Megarians, Boeotians, have the right to come and trade\\nhere, provided they sell their wares to me and not to Lamachus. As\\nmarket-inspectors I appoint these three whips of Leprean[229] leather,\\nchosen by lot. Warned away are all informers and all men of Phasis.[230]\\nThey are bringing me the pillar on which the treaty is inscribed[231] and\\nI shall erect it in the centre of the market, well in sight of all.\\n\\nA MEGARIAN. Hail! market of Athens, beloved of Megarians. Let Zeus, the\\npatron of friendship, witness, I regretted you as a mother mourns her\\nson. Come, poor little daughters of an unfortunate father, try to find\\nsomething to eat; listen to me with the full heed of an empty belly.\\nWhich would you prefer? To be sold or to cry with hunger.\\n\\nDAUGHTERS. To be sold, to be sold!\\n\\nMEGARIAN. That is my opinion too. But who would make so sorry a deal as\\nto buy you? Ah! I recall me a Megarian trick; I am going to disguise you\\nas little porkers, that I am offering for sale. Fit your hands with these\\nhoofs and take care to appear the issue of a sow of good breed, for, if I\\nam forced to take you back to the house, by Hermes! you will suffer\\ncruelly of hunger! Then fix on these snouts and cram yourselves into this\\nsack. Forget not to grunt and to say wee-wee like the little pigs that\\nare sacrificed in the Mysteries. I must summon Dicaeopolis. Where is he?\\nDicaeopolis, will you buy some nice little porkers?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Who are you? a Megarian?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. I have come to your market.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Well, how are things at Megara?[232]\\n\\nMEGARIAN. We are crying with hunger at our firesides.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. The fireside is jolly enough with a piper. But what else is\\ndoing at Megara, eh?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. What else? When I left for the market, the authorities were\\ntaking steps to let us die in the quickest manner.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. That is the best way to get you out of all your troubles.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. True.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What other news of Megara? What is wheat selling at?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. With us it is valued as highly as the very gods in heaven!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Is it salt that you are bringing?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Are you not holding back the salt?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. \\'Tis garlic then?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. What! garlic! do you not at every raid grub up the ground with\\nyour pikes to pull out every single head?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What _do_ you bring then?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Little sows, like those they immolate at the Mysteries.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! very well, show me them.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. They are very fine; feel their weight. See! how fat and fine.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. But what is this?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. A _sow_, for a certainty.[233]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. You say a sow! of what country, then?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. From Megara. What! is that not a sow then?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, I don\\'t believe it is.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. This is too much! what an incredulous man! He says \\'tis not a\\nsow; but we will stake, an you will, a measure of salt ground up with\\nthyme, that in good Greek this is called a sow and nothing else.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. But a sow of the human kind.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Without question, by Diocles! of my own breed! Well! What think\\nyou? will you hear them squeal?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Well, yes, i\\' faith, I will.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Cry quickly, wee sowlet; squeak up, hussy, or by Hermes! I take\\nyou back to the house.\\n\\nGIRL. Wee-wee, wee-wee!\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Is that a little sow, or not?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Yes, it seems so; but let it grow up, and it will be a fine\\nfat cunt.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. In five years it will be just like its mother.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. But it cannot be sacrificed.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. And why not?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. It has no tail.[234]\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Because it is quite young, but in good time it will have a big\\none, thick and red.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. The two are as like as two peas.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. They are born of the same father and mother; let them be\\nfattened, let them grow their bristles, and they will be the finest sows\\nyou can offer to Aphrodité.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. But sows are not immolated to Aphrodité.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Not sows to Aphrodité! Why, \\'tis the only goddess to whom they\\nare offered! the flesh of my sows will be excellent on the spit.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Can they eat alone? They no longer need their mother!\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Certainly not, nor their father.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What do they like most?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Whatever is given them; but ask for yourself.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Speak! little sow.\\n\\nDAUGHTER. Wee-wee, wee-wee!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Can you eat chick-pease?[235]\\n\\nDAUGHTER. Wee-wee, wee-wee, wee-wee!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And Attic figs?\\n\\nDAUGHTER. Wee-wee, wee-wee!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What sharp squeaks at the name of figs. Come, let some figs\\nbe brought for these little pigs. Will they eat them? Goodness! how they\\nmunch them, what a grinding of teeth, mighty Heracles! I believe those\\npigs hail from the land of the Voracians. But surely, \\'tis impossible\\nthey have bolted all the figs!\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Yes, certainly, bar this one that I took from them.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! what funny creatures! For what sum will you sell them?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. I will give you one for a bunch of garlic, and the other, if\\nyou like, for a quart measure of salt.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. I buy them of you. Wait for me here.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. The deal is done. Hermes, god of good traders, grant I may sell\\nboth my wife and my mother in the same way!\\n\\nAN INFORMER. Hi! fellow, what countryman are you?\\n\\nMEGARIAN. I am a pig-merchant from Megara.\\n\\nINFORMER. I shall denounce both your pigs and yourself as public enemies.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Ah! here our troubles begin afresh!\\n\\nINFORMER. Let go that sack. I will punish your Megarian lingo.[236]\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Dicaeopolis, Dicaeopolis, they want to denounce me.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Who dares do this thing? Inspectors, drive out the\\nInformers. Ah! you offer to enlighten us without a lamp![237]\\n\\nINFORMER. What! I may not denounce our enemies?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Have a care for yourself, if you don\\'t go off pretty quick\\nto denounce elsewhere.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. What a plague to Athens!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Be reassured, Megarian. Here is the value of your two swine,\\nthe garlic and the salt. Farewell and much happiness!\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Ah! we never have that amongst us.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Well! may the inopportune wish apply to myself.\\n\\nMEGARIAN. Farewell, dear little sows, and seek, far from your father, to\\nmunch your bread with salt, if they give you any.\\n\\nCHORUS. Here is a man truly happy. See how everything succeeds to his\\nwish. Peacefully seated in his market, he will earn his living; woe to\\nCtesias,[238] and all other informers, who dare to enter there! You will\\nnot be cheated as to the value of wares, you will not again see\\nPrepis[239] wiping his foul rump, nor will Cleonymus[240] jostle you; you\\nwill take your walks, clothed in a fine tunic, without meeting\\nHyperbolus[241] and his unceasing quibblings, without being accosted on\\nthe public place by any importunate fellow, neither by Cratinus,[242]\\nshaven in the fashion of the debauchees, nor by this musician, who\\nplagues us with his silly improvisations, Artemo, with his arm-pits\\nstinking as foul as a goat, like his father before him. You will not be\\nthe butt of the villainous Pauson\\'s[243] jeers, nor of Lysistratus,[244]\\nthe disgrace of the Cholargian deme, who is the incarnation of all the\\nvices, and endures cold and hunger more than thirty days in the month.\\n\\nA BOEOTIAN. By Heracles! my shoulder is quite black and blue. Ismenias,\\nput the penny-royal down there very gently, and all of you, musicians\\nfrom Thebes, pipe with your bone flutes into a dog\\'s rump.[245]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Enough, enough, get you gone. Rascally hornets, away with\\nyou! Whence has sprung this accursed swarm of Cheris[246] fellows which\\ncomes assailing my door?\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. Ah! by Iolas![247] Drive them off, my dear host, you will\\nplease me immensely; all the way from Thebes, they were there piping\\nbehind me and have completely stripped my penny-royal of its blossom. But\\nwill you buy anything of me, some chickens or some locusts?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! good day, Boeotian, eater of good round loaves.[248]\\nWhat do you bring?\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. All that is good in Boeotia, marjoram, penny-royal, rush-mats,\\nlamp-wicks, ducks, jays, woodcocks, waterfowl, wrens, divers.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. \\'Tis a very hail of birds that beats down on my market.\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. I also bring geese, hares, foxes, moles, hedgehogs, cats,\\nlyres, martins, otters and eels from the Copaic lake.[249]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! my friend, you, who bring me the most delicious of fish,\\nlet me salute your eels.\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. Come, thou, the eldest of my fifty Copaic virgins, come and\\ncomplete the joy of our host.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! my well-beloved, thou object of my long regrets, thou\\nart here at last then, thou, after whom the comic poets sigh, thou, who\\nart dear to Morychus.[250] Slaves, hither with the stove and the bellows.\\nLook at this charming eel, that returns to us after six long years of\\nabsence.[251] Salute it, my children; as for myself, I will supply coal\\nto do honour to the stranger. Take it into my house; death itself could\\nnot separate me from her, if cooked with beet leaves.\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. And what will you give me in return?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. It will pay for your market dues. And as to the rest, what\\ndo you wish to sell me?\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. Why, everything.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. On what terms? For ready-money or in wares from these parts?\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. I would take some Athenian produce, that we have not got in\\nBoeotia.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Phaleric anchovies, pottery?\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. Anchovies, pottery? But these we have. I want produce that is\\nwanting with us and that is plentiful here.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! I have the very thing; take away an Informer, packed up\\ncarefully as crockery-ware.\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. By the twin gods! I should earn big money, if I took one; I\\nwould exhibit him as an ape full of spite.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Hah! here we have Nicarchus,[252] who comes to denounce you.\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. How small he is!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. But in his case the whole is one mass of ill-nature.\\n\\nNICARCHUS. Whose are these goods?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Mine; they come from Boeotia, I call Zeus to witness.\\n\\nNICARCHUS. I denounce them as coming from an enemy\\'s country.\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. What! you declare war against birds?\\n\\nNICARCHUS. And I am going to denounce you too.\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. What harm have I done you?\\n\\nNICARCHUS. I will say it for the benefit of those that listen; you\\nintroduce lamp-wicks from an enemy\\'s country.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Then you go as far as denouncing a wick.\\n\\nNICARCHUS. It needs but one to set an arsenal afire.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. A wick set an arsenal ablaze! But how, great gods?\\n\\nNICARCHUS. Should a Boeotian attach it to an insect\\'s wing, and, taking\\nadvantage of a violent north wind, throw it by means of a tube into the\\narsenal and the fire once get hold of the vessels, everything would soon\\nbe devoured by the flames.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! wretch! an insect and a wick would devour everything.\\n(_He strikes him_.)\\n\\nNICARCHUS (_to the Chorus_). You will bear witness, that he mishandles\\nme.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Shut his mouth. Give him some hay; I am going to pack him up\\nas a vase, that he may not get broken on the road.\\n\\nCHORUS. Pack up your goods carefully, friend; that the stranger may not\\nbreak it when taking it away.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. I shall take great care with it, for one would say he is\\ncracked already; he rings with a false note, which the gods abhor.\\n\\nCHORUS. But what will be done with him?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. This is a vase good for all purposes; it will be used as a\\nvessel for holding all foul things, a mortar for pounding together\\nlaw-suits, a lamp for spying upon accounts, and as a cup for the mixing\\nup and poisoning of everything.\\n\\nCHORUS. None could ever trust a vessel for domestic use that has such a\\nring about it.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! it is strong, my friend, and will never get broken, if\\ncare is taken to hang it head downwards.\\n\\nCHORUS. There! it is well packed now!\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. Marry, I will proceed to carry off my bundle.\\n\\nCHORUS. Farewell, worthiest of strangers, take this Informer, good for\\nanything, and fling him where you like.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Bah! this rogue has given me enough trouble to pack! Here!\\nBoeotian, pick up your pottery.\\n\\nBOEOTIAN. Stoop, Ismenias, that I may put it on your shoulder, and be\\nvery careful with it.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. You carry nothing worth having; however, take it, for you\\nwill profit by your bargain; the Informers will bring you luck.\\n\\nA SERVANT OF LAMACHUS. Dicaeopolis!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What do want crying this gait?\\n\\nSERVANT. Lamachus wants to keep the Feast of Cups,[253] and I come by his\\norder to bid you one drachma for some thrushes and three more for a\\nCopaic eel.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And who is this Lamachus, who demands an eel?\\n\\nSERVANT. \\'Tis the terrible, indefatigable Lamachus, he, who is always\\nbrandishing his fearful Gorgon\\'s head and the three plumes which\\no\\'ershadow his helmet.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, no, he will get nothing, even though he gave me his\\nbuckler. Let him eat salt fish, while he shakes his plumes, and, if he\\ncomes here making any din, I shall call the inspectors. As for myself, I\\nshall take away all these goods; I go home on thrushes\\' wings and\\nblackbirds\\' pinions.[254]\\n\\nCHORUS. You see, citizens, you see the good fortune which this man owes\\nto his prudence, to his profound wisdom. You see how, since he has\\nconcluded peace, he buys what is useful in the household and good to eat\\nhot. All good things flow towards him unsought. Never will I welcome the\\ngod of war in my house; never shall he chant the \\'Harmodius\\' at my\\ntable;[255] he is a sot, who comes feasting with those who are\\noverflowing with good things and brings all sorts of mischief at his\\nheels. He overthrows, ruins, rips open; \\'tis vain to make him a thousand\\noffers, \"be seated, pray, drink this cup, proffered in all friendship,\"\\nhe burns our vine-stocks and brutally pours out the wine from our\\nvineyards on the ground. This man, on the other hand, covers his table\\nwith a thousand dishes; proud of his good fortunes, he has had these\\nfeathers cast before his door to show us how he lives.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! Peace! companion of fair Aphrodité and of the sweet\\nGraces, how charming are your features and yet I never knew it! Would\\nthat Eros might join me to thee, Eros, crowned with roses as Zeuxis[256]\\nshows him to us! Perhaps I seem somewhat old to you, but I am yet able to\\nmake you a threefold offering; despite my age, I could plant a long row\\nof vines for you; then beside these some tender cuttings from the fig;\\nfinally a young vine-stock, loaded with fruit and all round the field\\nolive trees, which would furnish us with oil, wherewith to anoint us both\\nat the New Moons.\\n\\nHERALD. List, ye people! As was the custom of your forebears, empty a\\nfull pitcher of wine at the call of the trumpet; he, who first sees the\\nbottom, shall get a wine-skin as round and plump as Ctesiphon\\'s belly.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Women, children, have you not heard? Faith! do you not heed\\nthe herald? Quick! let the hares boil and roast merrily; keep them\\na-turning; withdraw them from the flame; prepare the chaplets; reach me\\nthe skewers that I may spit the thrushes.\\n\\nCHORUS. I envy you your wisdom and even more your good cheer.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What then will you say when you see the thrushes roasting?\\n\\nCHORUS. Ah! true indeed!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Slave! stir up the fire.\\n\\nCHORUS. See, how he knows his business, what a perfect cook! How well he\\nunderstands the way to prepare a good dinner!\\n\\nA HUSBANDMAN. Ah! woe is me!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Heracles! What have we here?\\n\\nHUSBANDMAN. A most miserable man.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Keep your misery for yourself.\\n\\nHUSBANDMAN. Ah! friend! since you alone are enjoying peace, grant me a\\npart of your truce, were it but five years.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What has happened to you?\\n\\nHUSBANDMAN. I am ruined; I have lost a pair of steers.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. How?\\n\\nHUSBANDMAN. The Boeotians seized them at Phylé.[257]\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! poor wretch! and yet you have not left off white?\\n\\nHUSBANDMAN. Their dung made my wealth.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What can I do in the matter?\\n\\nHUSBANDMAN. Crying for my beasts has lost me my eyesight. Ah! if you care\\nfor poor Dercetes of Phylé, anoint mine eyes quickly with your balm of\\npeace.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. But, my poor fellow, I do not practise medicine.\\n\\nHUSBANDMAN. Come, I adjure you; perchance I shall recover my steers.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. \\'Tis impossible; away, go and whine to the disciples of\\nPittalus.[258]\\n\\n\\nHUSBANDMAN. Grant me but one drop of peace; pour it into this reedlet.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, not a particle; go a-weeping elsewhere.\\n\\nHUSBANDMAN. Oh! oh! oh! my poor beasts!\\n\\nCHORUS. This man has discovered the sweetest enjoyment in peace; he will\\nshare it with none.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Pour honey over this tripe; set it before the fire to dry.\\n\\nCHORUS. What lofty tones he uses! Did you hear him?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Get the eels on the gridiron!\\n\\nCHORUS. You are killing me with hunger; your smoke is choking your\\nneighbours, and you split our ears with your bawling.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Have this fried and let it be nicely browned.\\n\\nA BRIDESMAID. Dicaeopolis! Dicaeopolis!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Who are you?\\n\\nBRIDESMAID. A young bridegroom sends you these viands from the marriage\\nfeast.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Whoever he be, I thank him.\\n\\nBRIDESMAID. And in return, he prays you to pour a glass of peace into\\nthis vase, that he may not have to go to the front and may stay at home\\nto do his duty to his young wife.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Take back, take back your viands; for a thousand drachmae I\\nwould not give a drop of peace; but who are you, pray?\\n\\nBRIDESMAID. I am the bridesmaid; she wants to say something to you from\\nthe bride privately.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Come, what do you wish to say? (_The bridesmaid whispers in\\nhis ear._) _Ah!_ what a ridiculous demand! The bride burns with longing\\nto keep by her her husband\\'s weapon. Come! bring hither my truce; to her\\nalone will I give some of it, for she is a woman, and, as such, should\\nnot suffer under the war. Here, friend, reach hither your vial. And as to\\nthe manner of applying this balm, tell the bride, when a levy of soldiers\\nis made to rub some in bed on her husband, where most needed. There,\\nslave, take away my truce! Now, quick hither with the wine-flagon, that I\\nmay fill up the drinking bowls!\\n\\nCHORUS. I see a man, striding along apace, with knitted brows; he seems\\nto us the bearer of terrible tidings.\\n\\nHERALD. Oh! toils and battles! \\'tis Lamachus!\\n\\nLAMACHUS. What noise resounds around my dwelling, where shines the glint\\nof arms.\\n\\nHERALD. The Generals order you forthwith to take your battalions and your\\nplumes, and, despite the snow, to go and guard our borders. They have\\nlearnt that a band of Boeotians intend taking advantage of the feast of\\nCups to invade our country.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Ah! the Generals! they are numerous, but not good for much!\\nIt\\'s cruel, not to be able to enjoy the feast!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! warlike host of Lamachus!\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Wretch! do you dare to jeer me?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Do you want to fight this four-winged Geryon?\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Oh! oh! what fearful tidings!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! ah! I see another herald running up; what news does he\\nbring me?\\n\\nHERALD. Dicaeopolis!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What is the matter?\\n\\nHERALD. Come quickly to the feast and bring your basket and your cup;\\n\\'tis the priest of Bacchus who invites you. But hasten, the guests have\\nbeen waiting for you a long while. All is ready--couches, tables,\\ncushions, chaplets, perfumes, dainties and courtesans to boot; biscuits,\\ncakes, sesamé-bread, tarts, and--lovely dancing women, the sweetest charm\\nof the festivity. But come with all haste.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Oh! hostile gods!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. This is not astounding; you have chosen this huge, great\\nugly Gorgon\\'s head for your patron. You, shut the door, and let someone\\nget ready the meal.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Slave! slave! my knapsack!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Slave! slave! a basket!\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Take salt and thyme, slave, and don\\'t forget the onions.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Get some fish for me; I cannot bear onions.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Slave, wrap me up a little stale salt meat in a fig-leaf.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And for me some good greasy tripe in a fig-leaf; I will have\\nit cooked here.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Bring me the plumes for my helmet.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Bring me wild pigeons and thrushes.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. How white and beautiful are these ostrich feathers!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. How fat and well browned is the flesh of this wood-pigeon!\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Bring me the case for my triple plume.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Pass me over that dish of hare.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. _Oh!_ the moths have eaten the hair of my crest!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. I shall always eat hare before dinner.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Hi! friend! try not to scoff at my armour.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Hi! friend! will you kindly not stare at my thrushes.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Hi! friend! will you kindly not address me.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. I do not address you; I am scolding my slave. Shall we wager\\nand submit the matter to Lamachus, which of the two is the best to eat, a\\nlocust or a thrush?\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Insolent hound!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. He much prefers the locusts.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Slave, unhook my spear and bring it to me.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Slave, slave, take the sausage from the fire and bring it to\\nme.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Come, let me draw my spear from its sheath. Hold it, slave,\\nhold it tight.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And you, slave, grip, grip well hold of the skewer.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Slave, the bracings for my shield.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Pull the loaves out of the oven and bring me these bracings\\nof my stomach.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. My round buckler with the Gorgon\\'s head.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. My round cheese-cake.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. What clumsy wit!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. What delicious cheese-cake!\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Pour oil on the buckler. Hah! hah! I can see an old man who\\nwill be accused of cowardice.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Pour honey on the cake. Hah! hah! I can see an old man who\\nmakes Lamachus of the Gorgon\\'s head weep with rage.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Slave, full war armour.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Slave, my beaker; that is _my_ armour.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. With this I hold my ground with any foe.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And I with this with any tosspot.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Fasten the strappings to the buckler; personally I shall carry\\nthe knapsack.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Pack the dinner well into the basket; personally I shall\\ncarry the cloak.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Slave, take up the buckler and let\\'s be off. It is snowing! Ah!\\n\\'tis a question of facing the winter.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Take up the basket, \\'tis a question of getting to the feast.\\n\\nCHORUS. We wish you both joy on your journeys, which differ so much. One\\ngoes to mount guard and freeze, while the other will drink, crowned with\\nflowers, and then sleep with a young beauty, who will rub his tool for\\nhim.\\n\\nI say it freely; may Zeus confound Antimachus, the poet-historian, the\\nson of Psacas! When Choregus at the Lenaea, alas! alas! he dismissed me\\ndinnerless. May I see him devouring with his eyes a cuttle-fish, just\\nserved, well cooked, hot and properly salted; and the moment that he\\nstretches his hand to help himself, may a dog seize it and run off with\\nit. Such is my first wish. I also hope for him a misfortune at night.\\nThat returning all-fevered from horse practice, he may meet an\\nOrestes,[259] mad with drink, who breaks open his head; that wishing to\\nseize a stone, he, in the dark, may pick up a fresh stool, hurl his\\nmissile, miss aim and hit Cratinus.[260]\\n\\nSLAVE OF LAMACHUS. Slaves of Lamachus! Water, water in a little pot! Make\\nit warm, get ready cloths, cerate, greasy wool and bandages for his\\nankle. In leaping a ditch, the master has hurt himself against a stake;\\nhe has dislocated and twisted his ankle, broken his head by falling on a\\nstone, while his Gorgon shot far away from his buckler. His mighty\\nbraggadocio plume rolled on the ground; at this sight he uttered these\\ndoleful words, \"Radiant star, I gaze on thee for the last time; my eyes\\nclose to all light, I die.\" Having said this, he falls into the water,\\ngets out again, meets some runaways and pursues the robbers with his\\nspear at their backsides.[261] But here he comes, himself. Get the door\\nopen.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Oh! heavens! oh! heavens! What cruel pain! I faint, I tremble!\\nAlas! I die! the foe\\'s lance has struck me! But what would hurt me most\\nwould be for Dicaeopolis to see me wounded thus and laugh at my\\nill-fortune.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS (_enters with two courtesans_). Oh! my gods! what bosoms!\\nHard as a quince! Come, my treasures, give me voluptuous kisses! Glue\\nyour lips to mine. Haha! I was the first to empty my cup.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Oh! cruel fate! how I suffer! accursed wounds!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Hah! hah! hail! Knight Lamachus! (_Embraces Lamachus._)\\n\\nLAMACHUS. By the hostile gods! _(Bites Dicaeopolis.)_\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! great gods!\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Why do you embrace me?\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And why do you bite me?\\n\\nLAMACHUS. \\'Twas a cruel score I was paying back!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Scores are not evened at the feast of Cups!\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Oh! Paean, Paean!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. But to-day is not the feast of Paean.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Oh! support my leg, do; ah! hold it tenderly, my friends!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. And you, my darlings, take hold of my tool both of you!\\n\\nLAMACHUS. This blow with the stone makes me dizzy; my sight grows dim.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. For myself, I want to get to bed; I am bursting with\\nlustfulness, I want to be fucking in the dark.\\n\\nLAMACHUS. Carry me to the surgeon Pittalus.\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Take me to the judges. Where is the king of the feast? The\\nwine-skin is mine!\\n\\nLAMACHUS. That spear has pierced my bones; what torture I endure!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. You see this empty cup! I triumph! I triumph!\\n\\nCHORUS. Old man, I come at your bidding! You triumph! you triumph!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Again I have brimmed my cup with unmixed wine and drained it\\nat a draught!\\n\\nCHORUS. You triumph then, brave champion; thine is the wine-skin!\\n\\nDICAEOPOLIS. Follow me, singing \"Triumph! Triumph!\"\\n\\nCHORUS. Aye! we will sing of thee, thee and thy sacred wine-skin, and we\\nall, as we follow thee, will repeat in thine honour, \"Triumph, Triumph!\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFINIS OF \"THE ACHARNIANS\"', 'Olympus.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nPEACE\\n\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. Quick, quick, bring the dung-beetle his cake.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. Coming, coming.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. Give it to him, and may it kill him!\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. May he never eat a better.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. Now give him this other one kneaded up with ass\\'s dung.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. There! I\\'ve done that too.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. And where\\'s what you gave him just now; surely he can\\'t\\nhave devoured it yet!\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. Indeed he has; he snatched it, rolled it between his feet\\nand boiled it.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. Come, hurry up, knead up a lot and knead them stiffly.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. Oh, scavengers, help me in the name of the gods, if you\\ndo not wish to see me fall down choked.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. Come, come, another made of the stool of a young\\nscapegrace catamite. \\'Twill be to the beetle\\'s taste; he likes it well\\nground.[262]\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. There! I am free at least from suspicion; none will\\naccuse me of tasting what I mix.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. Faugh! come, now another! keep on mixing with all your\\nmight.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. I\\' faith, no. I can stand this awful cesspool stench no\\nlonger, so I bring you the whole ill-smelling gear.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. Pitch it down the sewer sooner, and yourself with it.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. Maybe, one of you can tell me where I can buy a\\nstopped-up nose, for there is no work more disgusting than to mix food\\nfor a beetle and to carry it to him. A pig or a dog will at least pounce\\nupon our excrement without more ado, but this foul wretch affects the\\ndisdainful, the spoilt mistress, and won\\'t eat unless I offer him a cake\\nthat has been kneaded for an entire day.... But let us open the door a\\nbit ajar without his seeing it. Has he done eating? Come, pluck up\\ncourage, cram yourself till you burst! The cursed creature! It wallows in\\nits food! It grips it between its claws like a wrestler clutching his\\nopponent, and with head and feet together rolls up its paste like a\\nropemaker twisting a hawser. What an indecent, stinking, gluttonous\\nbeast! I know not what angry god let this monster loose upon us, but of a\\ncertainty it was neither Aphrodité nor the Graces.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. Who was it then?\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. No doubt the Thunderer, Zeus.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. But perhaps some spectator, some beardless youth, who\\nthinks himself a sage, will say, \"What is this? What does the beetle\\nmean?\" And then an Ionian,[263] sitting next him, will add, \"I think \\'tis\\nan allusion to Cleon, who so shamelessly feeds on filth all by\\nhimself.\"--But now I\\'m going indoors to fetch the beetle a drink.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. As for me, I will explain the matter to you all,\\nchildren, youths, grown-ups and old men, aye, even to the decrepit\\ndotards. My master is mad, not as you are, but with another sort of\\nmadness, quite a new kind. The livelong day he looks open-mouthed towards\\nheaven and never stops addressing Zeus. \"Ah! Zeus,\" he cries, \"what are\\nthy intentions? Lay aside thy besom; do not sweep Greece away!\"\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! ah! ah!\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. Hush, hush! Methinks I hear his voice!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! Zeus, what art thou going to do for our people? Dost thou\\nnot see this, that our cities will soon be but empty husks?\\n\\nFIRST SLAVE. As I told you, that is his form of madness. There you have a\\nsample of his follies. When his trouble first began to seize him, he said\\nto himself, \"By what means could I go straight to Zeus?\" Then he made\\nhimself very slender little ladders and so clambered up towards heaven;\\nbut he soon came hurtling down again and broke his head. Yesterday, to\\nour misfortune, he went out and brought us back this thoroughbred, but\\nfrom where I know not, this great beetle, whose groom he has forced me to\\nbecome. He himself caresses it as though it were a horse, saying, \"Oh! my\\nlittle Pegasus,[264] my noble aerial steed, may your wings soon bear me\\nstraight to Zeus!\" But what is my master doing? I must stoop down to look\\nthrough this hole. Oh! great gods! Here! neighbours, run here quick! here\\nis my master flying off mounted on his beetle as if on horseback.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Gently, gently, go easy, beetle; don\\'t start off so proudly, or\\ntrust at first too greatly to your powers; wait till you have sweated,\\ntill the beating of your wings shall make your limb joints supple. Above\\nall things, don\\'t let off some foul smell, I adjure you; else I would\\nrather have you stop in the stable altogether.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. Poor master! Is he crazy?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Silence! silence!\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT (_to Trygaeus_). But why start up into the air on chance?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. \\'Tis for the weal of all the Greeks; I am attempting a daring\\nand novel feat.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. But what is your purpose? What useless folly!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No words of ill omen! Give vent to joy and command all men to\\nkeep silence, to close down their drains and privies with new tiles and\\nto stop their own vent-holes.[265]\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. No, I shall not be silent, unless you tell me where you\\nare going.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Why, where am I likely to be going across the sky, if it be not\\nto visit Zeus?\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT. For what purpose?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. I want to ask him what he reckons to do for all the Greeks.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. And if he doesn\\'t tell you?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. I shall pursue him at law as a traitor who sells Greece to the\\nMedes.[266]\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. Death seize me, if I let you go.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. It is absolutely necessary.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT. Alas! alas! dear little girls, your father is deserting\\nyou secretly to go to heaven. Ah! poor orphans, entreat him, beseech him.\\n\\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. Father! father! what is this I hear? Is it true? What!\\nyou would leave me, you would vanish into the sky, you would go to the\\ncrows?[267] \\'Tis impossible! Answer, father, an you love me.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Yes, I am going. You hurt me too sorely, my daughters, when you\\nask me for bread, calling me your daddy, and there is not the ghost of an\\nobolus in the house; if I succeed and come back, you will have a barley\\nloaf every morning--and a punch in the eye for sauce!\\n\\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. But how will you make the journey? \\'Tis not a ship that\\nwill carry you thither.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, but this winged steed will.\\n\\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. But what an idea, daddy, to harness a beetle, on which\\nto fly to the gods.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. We see from Aesop\\'s fables that they alone can fly to the abode\\nof the Immortals.[268]\\n\\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. Father, father, \\'tis a tale nobody can believe! that\\nsuch a stinking creature can have gone to the gods.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. It went to have vengeance on the eagle and break its eggs.\\n\\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. Why not saddle Pegasus? you would have a more\\n_tragic_[269] appearance in the eyes of the gods.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Eh! don\\'t you see, little fool, that then twice the food would\\nbe wanted? Whereas my beetle devours again as filth what I have eaten\\nmyself.\\n\\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. And if it fell into the watery depths of the sea, could\\nit escape with its wings?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS (_showing his penis_). I am fitted with a rudder in case of\\nneed, and my Naxos beetle will serve me as a boat.[270]\\n\\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. And what harbour will you put in at?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Why, is there not the harbour of Cantharos at the Piraeus?[271]\\n\\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. Take care not to knock against anything and so fall off\\ninto space; once a cripple, you would be a fit subject for Euripides, who\\nwould put you into a tragedy.[272]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. I\\'ll see to it. Good-bye! (_To the Athenians._) You, for love\\nof whom I brave these dangers, do ye neither let wind nor go to stool for\\nthe space of three days, for, if, while cleaving the air, my steed should\\nscent anything, he would fling me head foremost from the summit of my\\nhopes. Now come, my Pegasus, get a-going with up-pricked ears and make\\nyour golden bridle resound gaily. Eh! what are you doing? What are you up\\nto? Do you turn your nose towards the cesspools? Come, pluck up a spirit;\\nrush upwards from the earth, stretch out your speedy wings and make\\nstraight for the palace of Zeus; for once give up foraging in your daily\\nfood.--Hi! you down there, what are you after now? Oh! my god! \\'tis a man\\nemptying his belly in the Piraeus, close to the house where the bad girls\\nare. But is it my death you seek then, my death? Will you not bury that\\nright away and pile a great heap of earth upon it and plant wild thyme\\ntherein and pour perfumes on it? If I were to fall from up here and\\nmisfortune happened to me, the town of Chios[273]would owe a fine of five\\ntalents for my death, all along of your cursed rump. Alas! how frightened\\nI am! oh! I have no heart for jests. Ah! machinist, take great care of\\nme. There is already a wind whirling round my navel; take great care or,\\nfrom sheer fright, I shall form food for my beetle.... But I think I am\\nno longer far from the gods; aye, that is the dwelling of Zeus, I\\nperceive. Hullo! Hi! where is the doorkeeper? Will no one open?\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n_The scene changes and heaven is presented._\\n\\nHERMES. Meseems I can sniff a man. (_He perceives Trygaeus astride his\\nbeetle._) Why, what plague is this?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. A horse-beetle.\\n\\nHERMES. Oh! impudent, shameless rascal! oh! scoundrel! triple scoundrel!\\nthe greatest scoundrel in the world! how did you come here? Oh! scoundrel\\nof all scoundrels! your name? Reply.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Triple scoundrel.\\n\\nHERMES. Your country?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Triple scoundrel.\\n\\nHERMES. Your father?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. My father? Triple scoundrel.\\n\\nHERMES. By the Earth, you shall die, unless you tell me your name.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. I am Trygaeus of the Athmonian deme, a good vine-dresser,\\nlittle addicted to quibbling and not at all an informer.\\n\\nHERMES. Why do you come?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. I come to bring you this meat.\\n\\nHERMES. Ah! my good friend, did you have a good journey?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Glutton, be off! I no longer seem a triple scoundrel to you.\\nCome, call Zeus.\\n\\nHERMES. Ah! ah! you are a long way yet from reaching the gods, for they\\nmoved yesterday.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. To what part of the earth?\\n\\nHERMES. Eh! of the earth, did you say?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. In short, where are they then?\\n\\nHERMES. Very far, very far, right at the furthest end of the dome of\\nheaven.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. But why have they left you all alone here?\\n\\nHERMES. I am watching what remains of the furniture, the little pots and\\npans, the bits of chairs and tables, and odd wine-jars.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. And why have the gods moved away?\\n\\nHERMES. Because of their wrath against the Greeks. They have located War\\nin the house they occupied themselves and have given him full power to do\\nwith you exactly as he pleases; then they went as high up as ever they\\ncould, so as to see no more of your fights and to hear no more of your\\nprayers.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. What reason have they for treating us so?\\n\\nHERMES. Because they have afforded you an opportunity for peace more than\\nonce, but you have always preferred war. If the Laconians got the very\\nslightest advantage, they would exclaim, \"By the Twin Brethren! the\\nAthenians shall smart for this.\" If, on the contrary, the latter\\ntriumphed and the Laconians came with peace proposals, you would say, \"By\\nDemeter, they want to deceive us. No, by Zeus, we will not hear a word;\\nthey will always be coming as long as we hold Pylos.\"[274]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Yes, that is quite the style our folk do talk in.\\n\\nHERMES. So that I don\\'t know whether you will ever see Peace again.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Why, where has she gone to then?\\n\\nHERMES. War has cast her into a deep pit.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Where?\\n\\nHERMES. Down there, at the very bottom. And you see what heaps of stones\\nhe has piled over the top, so that you should never pull her out again.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Tell me, what is War preparing against us?\\n\\nHERMES. All I know is that last evening he brought along a huge mortar.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. And what is he going to do with his mortar?\\n\\nHERMES. He wants to pound up all the cities of Greece in it.... But I\\nmust say good-bye, for I think he is coming out; what an uproar he is\\nmaking!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! great gods! let us seek safety; meseems I already hear the\\nnoise of this fearful war mortar.\\n\\nWAR (_enters carrying a mortar_). Oh! mortals, mortals, wretched mortals,\\nhow your jaws will snap!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! divine Apollo! what a prodigious big mortar! Oh, what\\nmisery the very sight of War causes me! This then is the foe from whom I\\nfly, who is so cruel, so formidable, so stalwart, so solid on his legs!\\n\\nWAR. Oh! Prasiae![275] thrice wretched, five times, aye, a thousand times\\nwretched! for thou shalt be destroyed this day.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. This does not yet concern us over much; \\'tis only so much the\\nworse for the Laconians.\\n\\nWAR. Oh! Megara! Megara! how utterly are you going to be ground up! what\\nfine mincemeat[276] are you to be made into!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Alas! alas! what bitter tears there will be among the\\nMegarians![277]\\n\\nWAR. Oh, Sicily! you too must perish! Your wretched towns shall be grated\\nlike this cheese.[278] Now let us pour some Attic honey[279] into the\\nmortar.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! I beseech you! use some other honey; this kind is worth\\nfour obols; be careful, oh! be careful of our Attic honey.\\n\\nWAR. Hi! Tumult, you slave there!\\n\\nTUMULT. What do you want?\\n\\nWAR. Out upon you! You stand there with folded arms. Take this cuff o\\'\\nthe head for your pains.\\n\\nTUMULT. Oh! how it stings! Master, have you got garlic in your fist, I\\nwonder?\\n\\nWAR. Run and fetch me a pestle.\\n\\nTUMULT. But we haven\\'t got one; \\'twas only yesterday we moved.\\n\\nWAR. Go and fetch me one from Athens, and hurry, hurry!\\n\\nTUMULT. Aye, I hasten there; if I return without one, I shall have no\\ncause for laughing. [_Exit._\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! what is to become of us, wretched mortals that we are? See\\nthe danger that threatens if he returns with the pestle, for War will\\nquietly amuse himself with pounding all the towns of Hellas to pieces.\\nAh! Bacchus! cause this herald of evil to perish on his road!\\n\\nWAR. Well!\\n\\nTUMULT (_who has returned_). Well, what?\\n\\nWAR. You have brought back nothing?\\n\\nTUMULT. Alas! the Athenians have lost their pestle--the tanner, who\\nground Greece to powder.[280]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! Athené, venerable mistress! \\'tis well for our city he is\\ndead, and before he could serve us with this hash.\\n\\nWAR. Then go and seek one at Sparta and have done with it!\\n\\nTUMULT. Aye, aye, master!\\n\\nWAR. Be back as quick as ever you can.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS (_to the audience_). What is going to happen, friends? \\'Tis a\\ncritical hour. Ah! if there is some initiate of Samothrace[281] among\\nyou, \\'tis surely the moment to wish this messenger some accident--some\\nsprain or strain.\\n\\nTUMULT (_who returns_). Alas! alas! thrice again, alas!\\n\\nWAR. What is it? Again you come back without it?\\n\\nTUMULT. The Spartans too have lost their pestle.\\n\\nWAR. How, varlet?\\n\\nTUMULT. They had lent it to their allies in Thrace,[282] who have lost it\\nfor them.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Long life to you, Thracians! My hopes revive, pluck up courage,\\nmortals!\\n\\nWAR. Take all this stuff away; I am going in to make a pestle for myself.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. \\'Tis now the time to sing as Datis did, as he masturbated\\nhimself at high noon, \"Oh pleasure! oh enjoyment! oh delights!\" \\'Tis now,\\noh Greeks! the moment when freed of quarrels and fighting, we should\\nrescue sweet Peace and draw her out of this pit, before some other pestle\\nprevents us. Come, labourers, merchants, workmen, artisans, strangers,\\nwhether you be domiciled or not, islanders, come here, Greeks of all\\ncountries, come hurrying here with picks and levers and ropes! \\'Tis the\\nmoment to drain a cup in honour of the Good Genius.\\n\\nCHORUS. Come hither, all! quick, quick, hasten to the rescue! All peoples\\nof Greece, now is the time or never, for you to help each other. You see\\nyourselves freed from battles and all their horrors of bloodshed. The\\nday, hateful to Lamachus,[283] has come. Come then, what must be done?\\nGive your orders, direct us, for I swear to work this day without\\nceasing, until with the help of our levers and our engines we have drawn\\nback into light the greatest of all goddesses, her to whom the olive is\\nso dear.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Silence! if War should hear your shouts of joy he would bound\\nforth from his retreat in fury.\\n\\nCHORUS. Such a decree overwhelms us with joy; how different to the edict,\\nwhich bade us muster with provisions for three days.[284]\\n\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Let us beware lest the cursed Cerberus[285] prevent us even\\nfrom the nethermost hell from delivering the goddess by his furious\\nhowling, just as he did when on earth.\\n\\nCHORUS. Once we have hold of her, none in the world will be able to take\\nher from us. Huzza! huzza![286]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. You will work my death if you don\\'t subdue your shouts. War\\nwill come running out and trample everything beneath his feet.\\n\\nCHORUS. Well then! _Let_ him confound, let him trample, let him overturn\\neverything! We cannot help giving vent to our joy.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! cruel fate! My friends! in the name of the gods, what\\npossesses you? Your dancing will wreck the success of a fine undertaking.\\n\\nCHORUS. \\'Tis not I who want to dance; \\'tis my legs that bound with\\ndelight.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Enough, an you love me, cease your gambols.\\n\\nCHORUS. There! Tis over.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. You say so, and nevertheless you go on.\\n\\nCHORUS. Yet one more figure and \\'tis done.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Well, just this one; then you must dance no more.\\n\\nCHORUS. No, no more dancing, if we can help you.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. But look, you are not stopping even now.\\n\\nCHORUS. By Zeus, I am only throwing up my right leg, that\\'s all.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come, I grant you that, but pray, annoy me no further.\\n\\nCHORUS. Ah! the left leg too will have its fling; well, \\'tis but its\\nright. I am so happy, so delighted at not having to carry my buckler any\\nmore. I sing and I laugh more than if I had cast my old age, as a serpent\\ndoes its skin.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, \\'tis no time for joy yet, for you are not sure of success.\\nBut when you have got the goddess, then rejoice, shout and laugh;\\nthenceforward you will be able to sail or stay at home, to make love or\\nsleep, to attend festivals and processions, to play at cottabos,[287]\\nlive like true Sybarites and to shout, Io, io!\\n\\nCHORUS. Ah! God grant we may see the blessed day. I have suffered so\\nmuch; have so oft slept with Phormio[288] on hard beds. You will no\\nlonger find me an acid, angry, hard judge as heretofore, but will find me\\nturned indulgent and grown younger by twenty years through happiness. We\\nhave been killing ourselves long enough, tiring ourselves out with going\\nto the Lyceum[289] and returning laden with spear and buckler.--But what\\ncan we do to please you? Come, speak; for \\'tis a good Fate, that has\\nnamed you our leader.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. How shall we set about removing these stones?\\n\\nHERMES. Rash reprobate, what do you propose doing?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Nothing bad, as Cillicon said.[290]\\n\\n\\nHERMES. You are undone, you wretch.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Yes, if the lot had to decide my life, for Hermes would know\\nhow to turn the chance.[291]\\n\\nHERMES. You are lost, you are dead.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. On what day?\\n\\nHERMES. This instant.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. But I have not provided myself with flour and cheese yet[292]\\nto start for death.\\n\\nHERMES. You _are_ kneaded and ground already, I tell you.[293]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Hah! I have not yet tasted that gentle pleasure.\\n\\nHERMES. Don\\'t you know that Zeus has decreed death for him who is\\nsurprised exhuming Peace?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. What! must I really and truly die?\\n\\nHERMES. You must.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Well then, lend me three drachmae to buy a young pig; I wish to\\nhave myself initiated before I die.[294]\\n\\nHERMES. Oh! Zeus, the Thunderer![295]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. I adjure you in the name of the gods, master, don\\'t denounce\\nus!\\n\\nHERMES. I may not, I cannot keep silent.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. In the name of the meats which I brought you so good-naturedly.\\n\\nHERMES. Why, wretched man, Zeus will annihilate me, if I do not shout out\\nat the top of my voice, to inform him what you are plotting.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh, no! don\\'t shout, I beg you, dear little Hermes.... And what\\nare you doing, comrades? You stand there as though you were stocks and\\nstones. Wretched men, speak, entreat him at once; otherwise he will be\\nshouting.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! mighty Hermes! don\\'t do it; no, don\\'t do it! If ever you have\\neaten some young pig, sacrificed by us on your altars, with pleasure, may\\nthis offering not be without value in your sight to-day.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Do you not hear them wheedling you, mighty god?\\n\\nCHORUS. Be not pitiless toward our prayers; permit us to deliver the\\ngoddess. Oh! the most human, the most generous of the gods, be favourable\\ntoward us, if it be true that you detest the haughty crests and proud\\nbrows of Pisander;[296] we shall never cease, oh master, offering you\\nsacred victims and solemn prayers.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Have mercy, mercy, let yourself be touched by their words;\\nnever was your worship so dear to them as to-day.\\n\\nHERMES. I\\' truth, never have you been greater thieves.[297]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. I will reveal a great, a terrible conspiracy against the gods\\nto you.\\n\\nHERMES. Hah! speak and perchance I shall let myself be softened.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Know then, that the Moon and that infamous Sun are plotting\\nagainst you, and want to deliver Greece into the hands of the Barbarians.\\n\\nHERMES. What for?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Because it is to you that we sacrifice, whereas the barbarians\\nworship them; hence they would like to see you destroyed, that they alone\\nmight receive the offerings.\\n\\nHERMES. \\'Tis then for this reason that these untrustworthy charioteers\\nhave for so long been defrauding us, one of them robbing us of daylight\\nand the other nibbling away at the other\\'s disk.[298]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Yes, certainly. So therefore, Hermes, my friend, help us with\\nyour whole heart to find and deliver the captive and we will celebrate\\nthe great Panathenaea[299] in your honour as well as all the festivals of\\nthe other gods; for Hermes shall be the Mysteries, the Dipolia, the\\nAdonia; everywhere the towns, freed from their miseries, will sacrifice\\nto Hermes, the Liberator; you will be loaded with benefits of every kind,\\nand to start with, I offer you this cup for libations as your first\\npresent.\\n\\nHERMES. Ah! how golden cups do influence me! Come, friends, get to work.\\nTo the pit quickly, pick in hand and drag away the stones.\\n\\nCHORUS. We go, but you, the cleverest of all the gods, supervise our\\nlabours; tell us, good workman as you are, what we must do; we shall obey\\nyour orders with alacrity.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Quick, reach me your cup, and let us preface our work by\\naddressing prayers to the gods.\\n\\nHERMES. Oh! sacred, sacred libations! Keep silence, oh! ye people! keep\\nsilence!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Let us offer our libations and our prayers, so that this day\\nmay begin an era of unalloyed happiness for Greece and that he who has\\nbravely pulled at the rope with us may never resume his buckler.\\n\\nCHORUS. Aye, may we pass our lives in peace, caressing our mistresses and\\npoking the fire.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. May he who would prefer the war, oh Dionysus, be ever drawing\\nbarbed arrows out of his elbows.\\n\\nCHORUS. If there be a citizen, greedy for military rank and honours, who\\nrefuses, oh, divine Peace! to restore you to daylight, may he behave as\\ncowardly as Cleonymus on the battlefield.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. If a lance-maker or a dealer in shields desires war for the\\nsake of better trade, may he be taken by pirates and eat nothing but\\nbarley.\\n\\nCHORUS. If some ambitious man does not help us, because he wants to\\nbecome a General, or if a slave is plotting to pass over to the enemy,\\nlet his limbs be broken on the wheel, may he be beaten to death with\\nrods! As for us, may Fortune favour us! Io! Paean, Io!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Don\\'t say Paean,[300] but simply, Io.\\n\\nCHORUS. Very well, then! Io! Io! I\\'ll simply say, Io!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. To Hermes, the Graces, Hora, Aphrodité, Eros!\\n\\nCHORUS. And not to Ares?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No.\\n\\nCHORUS. Nor doubtless to Enyalius?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No.\\n\\nCHORUS. Come, all strain at the ropes to tear away the stones. Pull!\\n\\nHERMES. Heave away, heave, heave, oh!\\n\\nCHORUS. Come, pull harder, harder.\\n\\nHERMES. Heave away, heave, heave, oh!\\n\\nCHORUS. Still harder, harder still.\\n\\nHERMES. Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave, heave, oh!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come, come, there is no working together. Come! all pull at the\\nsame instant! you Boeotians are only pretending. Beware!\\n\\nHERMES. Come, heave away, heave!\\n\\nCHORUS. Hi! you two pull as well.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Why, I am pulling, I am hanging on to the rope and straining\\ntill I am almost off my feet; I am working with all my might.\\n\\nHERMES. Why does not the work advance then?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Lamachus, this is too bad! You are in the way, sitting there.\\nWe have no use for your Medusa\\'s head, friend.[301]\\n\\nHERMES. But hold, the Argives have not pulled the least bit; they have\\ndone nothing but laugh at us for our pains while they were getting gain\\nwith both hands.[302]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! my dear sir, the Laconians at all events pull with vigour.\\n\\nCHORUS. But look! only those among them who generally hold the\\nplough-tail show any zeal,[303] while the armourers impede them in their\\nefforts.\\n\\nHERMES. And the Megarians too are doing nothing, yet look how they are\\npulling and showing their teeth like famished curs; the poor wretches are\\ndying of hunger![304]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. This won\\'t do, friends. Come! all together! Everyone to the\\nwork and with a good heart for the business.\\n\\nHERMES. Heave away, heave!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Harder!\\n\\nHERMES. Heave away, heave!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come on then, by heaven.\\n\\nHERMES. Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave!\\n\\nCHORUS. This will never do.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Is it not a shame? some pull one way and others another. You,\\nArgives there, beware of a thrashing!\\n\\nHERMES. Come, put your strength into it.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Heave away, heave!\\n\\nCHORUS. There are many ill-disposed folk among us.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Do you at least, who long for peace, pull heartily.\\n\\nCHORUS. But there are some who prevent us.\\n\\nHERMES. Off to the Devil with you, Megarians! The goddess hates you. She\\nrecollects that you were the first to rub her the wrong way. Athenians,\\nyou are not well placed for pulling. There you are too busy with\\nlaw-suits; if you really want to free the goddess, get down a little\\ntowards the sea.[305]\\n\\nCHORUS. Come, friends, none but husbandmen on the rope.\\n\\nHERMES. Ah! that will do ever so much better.\\n\\nCHORUS. He says the thing is going well. Come, all of you, together and\\nwith a will.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. \\'Tis the husbandmen who are doing all the work.\\n\\nCHORUS. Come then, come, and all together! Hah! hah! at last there is\\nsome unanimity in the work. Don\\'t let us give up, let us redouble our\\nefforts. There! now we have it! Come then, all together! Heave away,\\nheave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave\\naway, heave! All together! (_Peace is drawn out of the pit._)\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! venerated goddess, who givest us our grapes, where am I to\\nfind the ten-thousand-gallon words[306] wherewith to greet thee? I have\\nnone such at home. Oh! hail to thee, Opora,[307] and thou, Theoria![308]\\nHow beautiful is thy face! How sweet thy breath! What gentle fragrance\\ncomes from thy bosom, gentle as freedom from military duty, as the most\\ndainty perfumes!\\n\\nHERMES. Is it then a smell like a soldier\\'s knapsack?\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! hateful soldier! your hideous satchel makes me sick! it\\nstinks like the belching of onions, whereas this lovable deity has the\\nodour of sweet fruits, of festivals, of the Dionysia, of the harmony of\\nflutes, of the comic poets, of the verses of Sophocles, of the phrases of\\nEuripides...\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. That\\'s a foul calumny, you wretch! She detests that framer of\\nsubtleties and quibbles.\\n\\nCHORUS. ... of ivy, of straining-bags for wine, of bleating ewes, of\\nprovision-laden women hastening to the kitchen, of the tipsy servant\\nwench, of the upturned wine-jar, and of a whole heap of other good\\nthings.\\n\\nHERMES. Then look how the reconciled towns chat pleasantly together, how\\nthey laugh; and yet they are all cruelly mishandled; their wounds are\\nbleeding still.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. But let us also scan the mien of the spectators; we shall thus\\nfind out the trade of each.\\n\\nHERMES. Ah! good gods! look at that poor crest-maker, tearing at his\\nhair,[309] and at that pike-maker, who has just broken wind in yon\\nsword-cutler\\'s face.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. And do you see with what pleasure this sickle-maker is making\\nlong noses at the spear-maker?\\n\\nHERMES. Now ask the husbandmen to be off.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Listen, good folk! Let the husbandmen take their farming tools\\nand return to their fields as quick as possible, but without either\\nsword, spear or javelin. All is as quiet as if Peace had been reigning\\nfor a century. Come, let everyone go till the earth, singing the Paean.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh, thou, whom men of standing desired and who art good to\\nhusbandmen, I have gazed upon thee with delight; and now I go to greet my\\nvines, to caress after so long an absence the fig trees I planted in my\\nyouth.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Friends, let us first adore the goddess, who has delivered us\\nfrom crests and Gorgons;[310] then let us hurry to our farms, having\\nfirst bought a nice little piece of salt fish to eat in the fields.\\n\\nHERMES. By Posidon! what a fine crew they make and dense as the crust of\\na cake; they are as nimble as guests on their way to a feast.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. See, how their iron spades glitter and how beautifully their\\nthree-pronged mattocks glisten in the sun! How regularly they will align\\nthe plants! I also burn myself to go into the country and to turn over\\nthe earth I have so long neglected.--Friends, do you remember the happy\\nlife that peace afforded us formerly; can you recall the splendid baskets\\nof figs, both fresh and dried, the myrtles, the sweet wine, the violets\\nblooming near the spring, and the olives, for which we have wept so much?\\nWorship, adore the goddess for restoring you so many blessings.\\n\\nCHORUS. Hail! hail! thou beloved divinity! thy return overwhelms us with\\njoy. When far from thee, my ardent wish to see my fields again made me\\npine with regret. From thee came all blessings. Oh! much desired Peace!\\nthou art the sole support of those who spend their lives tilling the\\nearth. Under thy rule we had a thousand delicious enjoyments at our beck;\\nthou wert the husbandman\\'s wheaten cake and his safeguard. So that our\\nvineyards, our young fig-tree woods and all our plantations hail thee\\nwith delight and smile at thy coming. But where was she then, I wonder,\\nall the long time she spent away from us? Hermes, thou benevolent god,\\ntell us!\\n\\nHERMES. Wise husbandmen, hearken to my words, if you want to know why she\\nwas lost to you. The start of our misfortunes was the exile of\\nPhidias;[311] Pericles feared he might share his ill-luck, he mistrusted\\nyour peevish nature and, to prevent all danger to himself, he threw out\\nthat little spark, the Megarian decree,[312] set the city aflame, and\\nblew up the conflagration with a hurricane of war, so that the smoke drew\\ntears from all Greeks both here and over there. At the very outset of\\nthis fire our vines were a-crackle, our casks knocked together;[313] it\\nwas beyond the power of any man to stop the disaster, and Peace\\ndisappeared.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. That, by Apollo! is what no one ever told me; I could not think\\nwhat connection there could be between Phidias and Peace.\\n\\nCHORUS. Nor I; I know it now. This accounts for her beauty, if she is\\nrelated to him. There are so many things that escape us.\\n\\nHERMES. Then, when the towns subject to you saw that you were angered one\\nagainst the other and were showing each other your teeth like dogs, they\\nhatched a thousand plots to pay you no more dues and gained over the\\nchief citizens of Sparta at the price of gold. They, being as shamelessly\\ngreedy as they were faithless in diplomacy, chased off Peace with\\nignominy to let loose War. Though this was profitable to them, \\'twas the\\nruin of the husbandmen, who were innocent of all blame; for, in revenge,\\nyour galleys went out to devour their figs.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. And \\'twas with justice too; did they not break down my black\\nfig tree, which I had planted and dunged with my own hands?\\n\\nCHORUS. Yes, by Zeus! yes, \\'twas well done; the wretches broke a chest\\nfor me with stones, which held six medimni of corn.\\n\\nHERMES. Then the rural labourers flocked into the city[314] and let\\nthemselves be bought over like the others. Not having even a grape-stone\\nto munch and longing after their figs, they looked towards the\\norators.[315] These well knew that the poor were driven to extremity and\\nlacked even bread; but they nevertheless drove away the Goddess each time\\nshe reappeared in answer to the wish of the country with their loud\\nshrieks, that were as sharp as pitchforks; furthermore, they attacked the\\nwell-filled purses of the richest among our allies on the pretence that\\nthey belonged to Brasidas\\' party.[316] And then you would tear the poor\\naccused wretch to pieces with your teeth; for the city, all pale with\\nhunger and cowed with terror, gladly snapped up any calumny that was\\nthrown it to devour. So the strangers, seeing what terrible blows the\\ninformers dealt, sealed their lips with gold. They grew rich, while you,\\nalas! you could only see that Greece was going to ruin. \\'Twas the tanner\\nwho was the author of all this woe.[317]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Enough said, Hermes, leave that man in Hades, whither he has\\ngone; he no longer belongs to us, but rather to yourself.[318] That he\\nwas a cheat, a braggart, a calumniator when alive, why, nothing could be\\ntruer; but anything you might say now would be an insult to one of your\\nown folk. Oh! venerated Goddess! why art thou silent?\\n\\nHERMES. And how could she speak to the spectators? She is too angry at\\nall that they have made her suffer.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. At least let her speak a little to you, Hermes.\\n\\nHERMES. Tell me, my dear, what are your feelings with regard to them?\\nCome, you relentless foe of all bucklers, speak; I am listening to you.\\n(_Peace whispers into Hermes\\' ear._) Is that your grievance against them?\\nYes, yes, I understand. Hearken, you folk, this is her complaint. She\\nsays, that after the affair of Pylos[319] she came to you unbidden to\\nbring you a basket full of truces and that you thrice repulsed her by\\nyour votes in the assembly.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Yes, we did wrong, but forgive us, for our mind was then\\nentirely absorbed in leather.[320]\\n\\nHERMES. Listen again to what she has just asked me. Who was her greatest\\nfoe here? and furthermore, had she a friend who exerted himself to put an\\nend to the fighting?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Her most devoted friend was Cleonymus; it is undisputed.\\n\\nHERMES. How then did Cleonymus behave in fights?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! the bravest of warriors! Only he was not born of the father\\nhe claims; he showed it quick enough in the army by throwing away his\\nweapons.[321]\\n\\nHERMES. There is yet another question she has just put to me. Who rules\\nnow in the rostrum?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. \\'Tis Hyperbolus, who now holds empire on the Pnyx. (_To\\nPeace._) What now? you turn away your head!\\n\\nHERMES. She is vexed, that the people should give themselves a wretch of\\nthat kind for their chief.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS Oh! we shall not employ him again; but the people, seeing\\nthemselves without a leader, took him haphazard, just as a man, who is\\nnaked, springs upon the first cloak he sees.\\n\\nHERMES. She asks, what will be the result of such a choice of the city?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. We shall be more far-seeing in consequence.\\n\\nHERMES. And why?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Because he is a lamp-maker. Formerly we only directed our\\nbusiness by groping in the dark; now we shall only deliberate by\\nlamplight.\\n\\nHERMES. Oh! oh! what questions she does order me to put to you!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. What are they?\\n\\nHERMES. She wants to have news of a whole heap of old-fashioned things\\nshe left here. First of all, how is Sophocles?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Very well; but something very strange has happened to him.\\n\\nHERMES. What then?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. He has turned from Sophocles into Simonides.[322]\\n\\nHERMES. Into Simonides? How so?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Because, though old and broken-down as he is, he would put to\\nsea on a hurdle to gain an obolus.[323]\\n\\nHERMES. And wise Cratinus, is he still alive?[324]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. He died about the time of the Laconian invasion.\\n\\nHERMES. How?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Of a swoon. He could not bear the shock of seeing one of his\\ncasks full of wine broken. Ah! what a number of other misfortunes our\\ncity has suffered! So, dearest mistress, nothing can now separate us from\\nthee.\\n\\nHERMES. If that be so, receive Opora here for a wife; take her to the\\ncountry, live with her, and grow fine grapes together.[325]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come, my dear friend, come and accept my kisses. Tell me,\\nHermes, my master, do you think it would hurt me to fuck her a little,\\nafter so long an abstinence?\\n\\nHERMES. No, not if you swallow a potion of penny-royal afterwards.[326]\\nBut hasten to lead Theoria[327] to the Senate; \\'twas there she lodged\\nbefore.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! fortunate Senate! Thanks to Theoria, what soups you will\\nswallow for the space of three days![328] how you will devour meats and\\ncooked tripe! Come, farewell, friend Hermes!\\n\\nHERMES. And to you also, my dear sir, may you have much happiness, and\\ndon\\'t forget me.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come, beetle, home, home, and let us fly on a swift wing.\\n\\nHERMES. Oh! he is no longer here.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Where has he gone to then?\\n\\nHERMES. He is harnessed to the chariot of Zeus and bears the\\nthunderbolts.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. But where will the poor wretch get his food?\\n\\nHERMES. He will eat Ganymede\\'s ambrosia.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Very well then, but how am I going to descend?\\n\\nHERMES. Oh! never fear, there is nothing simpler; place yourself beside\\nthe goddess.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come, my pretty maidens, follow me quickly; there are plenty of\\nfolk awaiting you with standing tools.\\n\\nCHORUS. Farewell and good luck be yours! Let us begin by handing over all\\nthis gear to the care of our servants, for no place is less safe than a\\ntheatre; there is always a crowd of thieves prowling around it, seeking\\nto find some mischief to do. Come, keep a good watch over all this. As\\nfor ourselves, let us explain to the spectators what we have in our\\nminds, the purpose of our play.\\n\\nUndoubtedly the comic poet who mounted the stage to praise himself in the\\nparabasis would deserve to be handed over to the sticks of the beadles.\\nNevertheless, oh Muse, if it be right to esteem the most honest and\\nillustrious of our comic writers at his proper value, permit our poet to\\nsay that he thinks he has deserved a glorious renown. First of all, \\'tis\\nhe who has compelled his rivals no longer to scoff at rags or to war with\\nlice; and as for those Heracles, always chewing and ever hungry, those\\npoltroons and cheats who allow themselves to be beaten at will, he was\\nthe first to cover them with ridicule and to chase them from the\\nstage;[329] he has also dismissed that slave, whom one never failed to\\nset a-weeping before you, so that his comrade might have the chance of\\njeering at his stripes and might ask, \"Wretch, what has happened to your\\nhide? Has the lash rained an army of its thongs on you and laid your back\\nwaste?\" After having delivered us from all these wearisome ineptitudes\\nand these low buffooneries, he has built up for us a great art, like a\\npalace with high towers, constructed of fine phrases, great thoughts and\\nof jokes not common on the streets. Moreover \\'tis not obscure private\\npersons or women that he stages in his comedies; but, bold as Heracles,\\n\\'tis the very greatest whom he attacks, undeterred by the fetid stink of\\nleather or the threats of hearts of mud. He has the right to say, \"I am\\nthe first ever dared to go straight for that beast with the sharp teeth\\nand the terrible eyes that flashed lambent fire like those of Cynna,[330]\\nsurrounded by a hundred lewd flatterers, who spittle-licked him to his\\nheart\\'s content; it had a voice like a roaring torrent, the stench of a\\nseal, a foul Lamia\\'s testicles and the rump of a camel.\"[331]\\n\\nI did not recoil in horror at the sight of such a monster, but fought him\\nrelentlessly to win your deliverance and that of the Islanders. Such are\\nthe services which should be graven in your recollection and entitle me\\nto your thanks. Yet I have not been seen frequenting the wrestling school\\nintoxicated with success and trying to tamper with young boys;[332] but I\\ntook all my theatrical gear[333] and returned straight home. I pained\\nfolk but little and caused them much amusement; my conscience rebuked me\\nfor nothing. Hence both grown men and youths should be on my side and I\\nlikewise invite the bald[334] to give me their votes; for, if I triumph,\\neveryone will say, both at table and at festivals, \"Carry this to the\\nbald man, give these cakes to the bald one, do not grudge the poet whose\\ntalent shines as bright as his own bare skull the share he deserves.\"\\n\\nOh, Muse! drive the War far from our city and come to preside over our\\ndances, if you love me; come and celebrate the nuptials of the gods, the\\nbanquets of us mortals and the festivals of the fortunate; these are the\\nthemes that inspire thy most poetic songs. And should Carcinus come to\\nbeg thee for admission with his sons to thy chorus, refuse all traffic\\nwith them; remember they are but gelded birds, stork-necked dancers,\\nmannikins about as tall as a pat of goat\\'s dung, in fact machine-made\\npoets.[335] Contrary to all expectation, the father has at last managed\\nto finish a piece, but he owns himself a cat strangled it one fine\\nevening.[336]\\n\\nSuch are the songs[337] with which the Muse with the glorious hair\\ninspires the able poet and which enchant the assembled populace, when the\\nspring swallow twitters beneath the foliage;[338] but the god spare us\\nfrom the chorus of Morsimus and that of Melanthius![339] Oh! what a\\nbitter discordancy grated upon my ears that day when the tragic chorus\\nwas directed by this same Melanthius and his brother, these two\\nGorgons,[340] these two harpies, the plague of the seas, whose gluttonous\\nbellies devour the entire race of fishes, these followers of old women,\\nthese goats with their stinking arm-pits. Oh! Muse, spit upon them\\nabundantly and keep the feast gaily with me.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! \\'tis a rough job getting to the gods! my legs are as good\\nas broken through it. How small you were, to be sure, when seen from\\nheaven! you had all the appearance too of being great rascals; but seen\\nclose, you look even worse.\\n\\nSERVANT. Is that you, master?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. So I have been told.\\n\\nSERVANT. What has happened to you?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. My legs pain me; it is such a plaguey long journey.\\n\\nSERVANT. Oh! do tell me....\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. What?\\n\\nSERVANT. Did you see any other man besides yourself strolling about in\\nheaven?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, only the souls of two or three dithyrambic poets.\\n\\nSERVANT. What were they doing up there?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. They were seeking to catch some lyric exordia as they flew by\\nimmersed in the billows of the air.\\n\\nSERVANT. Is it true, what they tell us, that men are turned into stars\\nafter death?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Quite true.\\n\\nSERVANT. Then who is that star I see over yonder?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. That is Ion of Chios,[341] the author of an ode beginning\\n\"Morning\"; as soon as ever he got to heaven, they called him \"the Morning\\nStar.\"\\n\\nSERVANT. And those stars like sparks, that plough up the air as they dart\\nacross the sky?[342]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. They are the rich leaving the feast with a lantern and a light\\ninside it. But hurry up, show this young girl into my house, clean out\\nthe bath, heat some water and prepare the nuptial couch for herself and\\nme. When \\'tis done, come back here; meanwhile I am off to present this\\none to the Senate.\\n\\nSERVANT. But where then did you get these pretty chattels?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Where? why in heaven.\\n\\nSERVANT. I would not give more than an obolus for gods who have got to\\nkeeping brothels like us mere mortals.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. They are not all so, but there are some up there too who live\\nby this trade.\\n\\nSERVANT. Come, that\\'s rich! But I bethink me, shall I give her something\\nto eat?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, for she would neither touch bread nor cake; she is used to\\nlicking ambrosia at the table of the gods.\\n\\nSERVANT. Well, we can give her something to lick down here too.[343]\\n\\nCHORUS. Here is a truly happy old man, as far as I can judge.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! but what shall I be, when you see me presently dressed for\\nthe wedding?\\n\\nCHORUS. Made young again by love and scented with perfumes, your lot will\\nbe one we all shall envy.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. And when I lie beside her and caress her bosoms?\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! then you will be happier than those spinning-tops who call\\nCarcinus their father.[344]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. And I well deserve it; have I not bestridden a beetle to save\\nthe Greeks, who now, thanks to me, can make love at their ease and sleep\\npeacefully on their farms?\\n\\nSERVANT. The girl has quitted the bath; she is charming from head to\\nfoot, both belly and buttocks; the cake is baked and they are kneading\\nthe sesame-biscuit;[345] nothing is lacking but the bridegroom\\'s penis.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Let us first hasten to lodge Theoria in the hands of the\\nSenate.\\n\\nSERVANT. But tell me, who is this woman?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Why, \\'tis Theoria, with whom we used formerly to go to\\nBrauron,[346] to get tipsy and frolic. I had the greatest trouble to get\\nhold of her.\\n\\nSERVANT. Ah! you charmer! what pleasure your pretty bottom will afford me\\nevery four years!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Let us see, who of you is steady enough to be trusted by the\\nSenate with the care of this charming wench? Hi! you, friend! what are\\nyou drawing there?\\n\\nSERVANT. I am drawing the plan of the tent I wish to erect for myself on\\nthe isthmus.[347]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come, who wishes to take the charge of her? No one? Come,\\nTheoria, I am going to lead you into the midst of the spectators and\\nconfide you to their care.\\n\\nSERVANT. Ah! there is one who makes a sign to you.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Who is it?\\n\\nSERVANT. \\'Tis Ariphrades. He wishes to take her home at once.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, I\\'m sure he shan\\'t. He would soon have her done for,\\nlicking up all her life juice.[348] Come, Theoria, put down all this\\ngear.[349]--Senate, Prytanes, look upon Theoria and see what precious\\nblessings I place in your hands.[350] Hasten to raise its limbs and to\\nimmolate the victim. Admire the fine chimney,[351] it is quite black with\\nsmoke, for \\'twas here that the Senate did their cooking before the War.\\nNow that you have found Theoria again, you can start the most charming\\ngames from to-morrow, wrestling with her on the ground, either on your\\nhands and feet, or you can lay her on her side, or stand before her with\\nbent knees, or, well rubbed with oil, you can boldly enter the lists, as\\nin the Pancratium, belabouring your foe with blows from your fist or\\notherwise.[352] The next day you will celebrate equestrian games, in\\nwhich the riders will ride side by side, or else the chariot teams,\\nthrown one on top of another, panting and whinnying, will roll and knock\\nagainst each other on the ground, while other rivals, thrown out of their\\nseats, will fall before reaching the goal, utterly exhausted by their\\nefforts.--Come, Prytanes, take Theoria. Oh! look how graciously yonder\\nfellow has received her; you would not have been in such a hurry to\\nintroduce her to the Senate, if nothing were coming to you through\\nit;[353] you would not have failed to plead some holiday as an excuse.\\n\\nCHORUS. Such a man as you assures the happiness of all his\\nfellow-citizens.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. When you are gathering your vintages you will prize me even\\nbetter.\\n\\nCHORUS. E\\'en from to-day we hail you as the deliverer of mankind.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Wait until you have drunk a beaker of new wine, before you\\nappraise my true merits.\\n\\nCHORUS. Excepting the gods, there is none greater than yourself, and that\\nwill ever be our opinion.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Yea, Trygaeus of Athmonia has deserved well of you, he has\\nfreed both husbandman and craftsman from the most cruel ills; he has\\nvanquished Hyperbolus.\\n\\nCHORUS. Well then, what must we do now?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. You must offer pots of green-stuff to the goddess to consecrate\\nher altars.\\n\\nCHORUS. Pots of green-stuff[354] as we do to poor Hermes--and even he\\nthinks the fare but mean?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. What will you offer then? A fatted bull?\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh, no! I don\\'t want to start bellowing the battle-cry.[355]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. A great fat swine then?\\n\\nCHORUS. No, no.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Why not?\\n\\nCHORUS. We don\\'t want any of the swinishness of Theagenes.[356]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. What other victim do you prefer then?\\n\\nCHORUS. A sheep.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. A sheep?\\n\\nCHORUS. Yes.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. But you must give the word the Ionic form.\\n\\nCHORUS. Purposely. So that if anyone in the assembly says, \"We must go to\\nwar,\" all may start bleating in alarm, \"Oï, oï.\"[357]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. A brilliant idea.\\n\\nCHORUS. And we shall all be lambs one toward the other, yea, and milder\\nstill toward the allies.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Then go for the sheep and haste to bring it back with you; I\\nwill prepare the altar for the sacrifice.\\n\\nCHORUS. How everything succeeds to our wish, when the gods are willing\\nand Fortune favours us! how opportunely everything falls out.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Nothing could be truer, for look! here stands the altar all\\nready at my door.\\n\\nCHORUS. Hurry, hurry, for the winds are fickle; make haste, while the\\ndivine will is set on stopping this cruel war and is showering on us the\\nmost striking benefits.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Here is the basket of barley-seed mingled with salt, the\\nchaplet and the sacred knife; and there is the fire; so we are only\\nwaiting for the sheep.\\n\\nCHORUS. Hasten, hasten, for, if Chaeris sees you, he will come without\\nbidding, he and his flute; and when you see him puffing and panting and\\nout of breath, you will have to give him something.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come, seize the basket and take the lustral water and hurry to\\ncircle round the altar to the right.\\n\\nSERVANT. There! \\'tis done. What is your next bidding?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Hold! I take this fire-brand first and plunge it into the\\nwater.\\n\\nSERVANT. Be quick! be quick! Sprinkle the altar.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Give me some barley-seed, purify yourself and hand me the\\nbasin; then scatter the rest of the barley among the audience.\\n\\nSERVANT. \\'Tis done.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. You have thrown it?\\n\\nSERVANT. Yes, by Hermes! and all the spectators have had their share.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. But not the women?\\n\\nSERVANT. Oh! their husbands will give it them this evening.[358]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Let us pray! Who is here? Are there any good men?[359]\\n\\nSERVANT. Come, give, so that I may sprinkle these. Faith! they are indeed\\ngood, brave men.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. You believe so?\\n\\nSERVANT. I am sure, and the proof of it is that we have flooded them with\\nlustral water and they have not budged an inch.[360]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come then, to prayers; to prayers, quick!--Oh! Peace, mighty\\nqueen, venerated goddess, thou, who presidest over choruses and at\\nnuptials, deign to accept the sacrifices we offer thee.\\n\\nSERVANT. Receive it, greatly honoured mistress, and behave not like the\\ncoquettes, who half open the door to entice the gallants, draw back when\\nthey are stared at, to return once more if a man passes on. But do not\\nact like this to us.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, but like an honest woman, show thyself to thy worshippers,\\nwho are worn with regretting thee all these thirteen years. Hush the\\nnoise of battle, be a true Lysimacha to us.[361] Put an end to this\\ntittle-tattle, to this idle babble, that set us defying one another.\\nCause the Greeks once more to taste the pleasant beverage of friendship\\nand temper all hearts with the gentle feeling of forgiveness. Make\\nexcellent commodities flow to our markets, fine heads of garlic, early\\ncucumbers, apples, pomegranates and nice little cloaks for the slaves;\\nmake them bring geese, ducks, pigeons and larks from Boeotia and baskets\\nof eels from Lake Copaïs; we shall all rush to buy them, disputing their\\npossession with Morychus, Teleas, Glaucetes and every other glutton.\\nMelanthius[362] will arrive on the market last of all; \\'twill be, \"no\\nmore eels, all sold!\" and then he\\'ll start a-groaning and exclaiming as\\nin his monologue of Medea,[363] \"I am dying, I am dying! Alas! I have let\\nthose hidden in the beet escape me!\"[364] And won\\'t we laugh? These are\\nthe wishes, mighty goddess, which we pray thee to grant.\\n\\nSERVANT. Take the knife and slaughter the sheep like a finished cook.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, the goddess does not wish it.[365]\\n\\nSERVANT. And why not?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Blood cannot please Peace, so let us spill none upon her altar.\\nTherefore go and sacrifice the sheep in the house, cut off the legs and\\nbring them here; thus the carcase will be saved for the choragus.\\n\\nCHORUS. You, who remain here, get chopped wood and everything needed for\\nthe sacrifice ready.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Don\\'t I look like a diviner preparing his mystic fire?\\n\\nCHORUS. Undoubtedly. Will anything that it behoves a wise man to know\\nescape you? Don\\'t you know all that a man should know, who is\\ndistinguished for his wisdom and inventive daring?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. There! the wood catches. Its smoke blinds poor Stilbides.[366]\\nI am now going to bring the table and thus be my own slave.\\n\\nCHORUS. You have braved a thousand dangers to save your sacred town. All\\nhonour to you! your glory will be ever envied.\\n\\nSERVANT. Hold! here are the legs, place them upon the altar. For myself,\\nI mean to go back to the entrails and the cakes.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. I\\'ll see to those; I want you here.\\n\\nSERVANT. Well then, here I am. Do you think I have been long?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Just get this roasted. Ah! who is this man, crowned with\\nlaurel, who is coming to me?\\n\\nSERVANT. He has a self-important look; is he some diviner?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, i\\' faith! \\'tis Hierocles.\\n\\nSERVANT. Ah! that oracle-monger from Oreus.[367] What is he going to tell\\nus?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Evidently he is coming to oppose the peace.\\n\\nSERVANT. No, \\'tis the odour of the fat that attracts him.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Let us appear not to see him.\\n\\nSERVANT. Very well.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. What sacrifice is this? to what god are you offering it?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS (_to the servant_). Silence!--(_Aloud._) Look after the roasting\\nand keep your hands off the meat.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. To whom are you sacrificing? Answer me. Ah! the tail[368] is\\nshowing favourable omens.\\n\\nSERVANT. Aye, very favourable, oh, loved and mighty Peace!\\n\\nHIEROCLES. Come, cut off the first offering[369] and make the oblation.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. \\'Tis not roasted enough.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. Yea, truly, \\'tis done to a turn.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Mind your own business, friend! (_To the servant._) Cut away.\\nWhere is the table? Bring the libations.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. The tongue is cut separately.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. We know all that. But just listen to one piece of advice.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. And that is?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Don\\'t talk, for \\'tis divine Peace to whom we are sacrificing.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. Oh! wretched mortals, oh, you idiots!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Keep such ugly terms for yourself.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. What! you are so ignorant you don\\'t understand the will of the\\ngods and you make a treaty, you, who are men, with apes, who are full of\\nmalice![370]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Ha, ha, ha!\\n\\nHIEROCLES. What are you laughing at?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Ha, ha! your apes amuse me!\\n\\nHIEROCLES. You simple pigeons, you trust yourselves to foxes, who are all\\ncraft, both in mind and heart.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh, you trouble-maker! may your lungs get as hot as this meat!\\n\\nHIEROCLES. Nay, nay! if only the Nymphs had not fooled Bacis, and Bacis\\nmortal men; and if the Nymphs had not tricked Bacis a second\\ntime[371]....\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. May the plague seize you, if you won\\'t stop wearying us with\\nyour Bacis!\\n\\nHIEROCLES. ... it would not have been written in the book of Fate that\\nthe bonds of Peace must be broken; but first....\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. The meat must be dusted with salt.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. ... it does not please the blessed gods that we should stop\\nthe War until the wolf uniteth with the sheep.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. How, you cursed animal, could the wolf ever unite with the\\nsheep?\\n\\nHIEROCLES. As long as the wood-bug gives off a fetid odour, when it\\nflies; as long as the noisy bitch is forced by nature to litter blind\\npups, so long shall peace be forbidden.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Then what should be done? Not to stop the War would be to leave\\nit to the decision of chance which of the two people should suffer the\\nmost, whereas by uniting under a treaty, we share the empire of Greece.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. You will never make the crab walk straight.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. You shall no longer be fed at the Prytaneum; the war done,\\noracles are not wanted.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. You will never smooth the rough spikes of the hedgehog.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Will you never stop fooling the Athenians?\\n\\nHIEROCLES. What oracle ordered you to burn these joints of mutton in\\nhonour of the gods?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. This grand oracle of Homer\\'s: \"Thus vanished the dark\\nwar-clouds and we offered a sacrifice to new-born Peace. When the flame\\nhad consumed the thighs of the victim and its inwards had appeased our\\nhunger, we poured out the libations of wine.\" \\'Twas I who arranged the\\nsacred rites, but none offered the shining cup to the diviner.[372]\\n\\nHIEROCLES. I care little for that. \\'Tis not the Sibyl who spoke it.[373]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Wise Homer has also said: \"He who delights in the horrors of\\ncivil war has neither country nor laws nor home.\" What noble words!\\n\\nHIEROCLES. Beware lest the kite turn your brain and rob....\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Look out, slave! This oracle threatens our meat. Quick, pour\\nthe libation, and give me some of the inwards.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. I too will help myself to a bit, if you like.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. The libation! the libation!\\n\\nHIEROCLES. Pour out also for me and give me some of this meat.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, the blessed gods won\\'t allow it yet; let us drink; and as\\nfor you, get you gone, for \\'tis their will. Mighty Peace! stay ever in\\nour midst.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. Bring the tongue hither.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Relieve us of your own.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. The libation.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Here! and this into the bargain (_strikes him_).\\n\\nHIEROCLES. You will not give me any meat?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. We cannot give you any until the wolf unites with the sheep.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. I will embrace your knees.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. \\'Tis lost labour, good fellow; you will never smooth the rough\\nspikes of the hedgehog.... Come, spectators, join us in our feast.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. And what am I to do?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. You? go and eat the Sibyl.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. No, by the Earth! no, you shall not eat without me; if you do\\nnot give, I take; \\'tis common property.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS (_to the servant_). Strike, strike this Bacis, this humbugging\\nsoothsayer.\\n\\nHIEROCLES. I take to witness....\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. And I also, that you are a glutton and an impostor. Hold him\\ntight and beat the impostor with a stick.\\n\\nSERVANT. You look to that; I will snatch the skin from him, which he has\\nstolen from us.[374] Are you going to let go that skin, you priest from\\nhell! do you hear! Oh! what a fine crow has come from Oreus! Stretch your\\nwings quickly for Elymnium.[375]\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! joy, joy! no more helmet, no more cheese nor onions![376] No,\\nI have no passion for battles; what I love, is to drink with good\\ncomrades in the corner by the fire when good dry wood, cut in the height\\nof the summer, is crackling; it is to cook pease on the coals and\\nbeechnuts among the embers; \\'tis to kiss our pretty Thracian[377] while\\nmy wife is at the bath. Nothing is more pleasing, when the rain is\\nsprouting our sowings, than to chat with some friend, saying, \"Tell me,\\nComarchides, what shall we do? I would willingly drink myself, while the\\nheavens are watering our fields. Come, wife, cook three measures of\\nbeans, adding to them a little wheat, and give us some figs. Syra! call\\nManes off the fields, \\'tis impossible to prune the vine or to align the\\nridges, for the ground is too wet to-day. Let someone bring me the thrush\\nand those two chaffinches; there were also some curds and four pieces of\\nhare, unless the cat stole them last evening, for I know not what the\\ninfernal noise was that I heard in the house. Serve up three of the\\npieces for me, slave, and give the fourth to my father. Go and ask\\nAeschinades for some myrtle branches with berries on them, and then, for\\n\\'tis the same road, you will invite Charinades to come and drink with me\\nto the honour of the gods who watch over our crops.\"\\n\\nWhen the grasshopper sings its dulcet tune, I love to see the Lemnian\\nvines beginning to ripen, for \\'tis the earliest plant of all. I love\\nlikewise to watch the fig filling out, and when it has reached maturity I\\neat with appreciation and exclaim, \"Oh! delightful season!\" Then too I\\nbruise some thyme and infuse it in water. Indeed I grow a great deal\\nfatter passing the summer this way than in watching a cursed captain with\\nhis three plumes and his military cloak of a startling crimson (he calls\\nit true Sardian purple), which he takes care to dye himself with Cyzicus\\nsaffron in a battle; then he is the first to run away, shaking his plumes\\nlike a great yellow prancing cock,[378] while I am left to watch the\\nnets.[379] Once back again in Athens, these brave fellows behave\\nabominably; they write down these, they scratch through others, and this\\nbackwards and forwards two or three times at random. The departure is set\\nfor to-morrow, and some citizen has brought no provisions, because he\\ndidn\\'t know he had to go; he stops in front of the statue of\\nPandion,[380] reads his name, is dumbfounded and starts away at a run,\\nweeping bitter tears. The townsfolk are less ill-used, but that is how\\nthe husbandmen are treated by these men of war, the hated of the gods and\\nof men, who know nothing but how to throw away their shield. For this\\nreason, if it please heaven, I propose to call these rascals to account,\\nfor they are lions in times of peace, but sneaking foxes when it comes to\\nfighting.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! oh! what a crowd for the nuptial feast! Here! dust the\\ntables with this crest, which is good for nothing else now. Halloa!\\nproduce the cakes, the thrushes, plenty of good jugged hare and the\\nlittle loaves.\\n\\nA SICKLE-MAKER. Trygaeus, where is Trygaeus?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. I am cooking the thrushes.\\n\\nSICKLE-MAKER. Trygaeus, my best of friends, what a fine stroke of\\nbusiness you have done for me by bringing back Peace! Formerly my sickles\\nwould not have sold at an obolus apiece, to-day I am being paid fifty\\ndrachmas for every one. And here is a neighbour who is selling his casks\\nfor the country at three drachmae each. So come, Trygaeus, take as many\\nsickles and casks as you will for nothing. Accept them for nothing; \\'tis\\nbecause of our handsome profits on our sales that we offer you these\\nwedding presents.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Thanks. Put them all down inside there, and come along quick to\\nthe banquet. Ah! do you see that armourer yonder coming with a wry face?\\n\\nA CREST-MAKER. Alas! alas! Trygaeus, you have ruined me utterly.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. What! won\\'t the crests go any more, friend?\\n\\nCREST-MAKER. You have killed my business, my livelihood, and that of this\\npoor lance-maker too.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come, come, what are you asking for these two crests?\\n\\nCREST-MAKER. What do you bid for them?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. What do I bid? Oh! I am ashamed to say. Still, as the clasp is\\nof good workmanship, I would give two, even three measures of dried figs;\\nI could use \\'em for dusting the table.\\n\\nCREST-MAKER. All right, tell them to bring me the dried figs; \\'tis always\\nbetter than nothing.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Take them away, be off with your crests and get you gone; they\\nare moulting, they are losing all their hair; I would not give a single\\nfig for them.\\n\\nA BREASTPLATE-MAKER. Good gods, what am I going to do with this fine\\nten-minae breast-plate, which is so splendidly made?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh, you will lose nothing over it.\\n\\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. I will sell it you at cost price.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. \\'Twould be very useful as a night-stool....\\n\\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. Cease your insults, both to me and my wares.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. ... if propped on three stones. Look, \\'tis admirable.\\n\\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. But how can you wipe, idiot?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. I can pass one hand through here, and the other there, and\\nso....\\n\\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. What! do you wipe with both hands?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Aye, so that I may not be accused of robbing the State, by\\nblocking up an oar-hole in the galley.[381]\\n\\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. So you would pay ten minae[382] for a night-stool?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Undoubtedly, you rascal. Do you think I would sell my rump for\\na thousand drachmae?[383]\\n\\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. Come, have the money paid over to me.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, friend; I find it hurts me to sit on. Take it away, I won\\'t\\nbuy.\\n\\nA TRUMPET-MAKER. What is to be done with this trumpet, for which I gave\\nsixty drachmae the other day?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Pour lead into the hollow and fit a good, long stick to the\\ntop; and you will have a balanced cottabos.[384]\\n\\nTRUMPET-MAKER. Ha! would you mock me?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Well, here\\'s another notion. Pour in lead as I said, add here a\\ndish hung on strings, and you will have a balance for weighing the figs\\nwhich you give your slaves in the fields.\\n\\nA HELMET-MAKER. Cursed fate! I am ruined. Here are helmets, for which I\\ngave a mina each. What am I to do with them? who will buy them?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Go and sell them to the Egyptians; they will do for measuring\\nloosening medicines.[385]\\n\\nA SPEAR-MAKER. Ah! poor helmet-maker, things are indeed in a bad way.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. That man has no cause for complaint.\\n\\nSPEAR-MAKER. But helmets will be no more used.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Let him learn to fit a handle to them and he can sell them for\\nmore money.[386]\\n\\nSPEAR-MAKER. Let us be off, comrade.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. No, I want to buy these spears.\\n\\nSPEAR-MAKER. What will you give?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. If they could be split in two, I would take them at a drachma\\nper hundred to use as vine-props.\\n\\nSPEAR-MAKER. The insolent dog! Let us go, friend.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! here come the guests, children from the table to relieve\\nthemselves; I fancy they also want to hum over what they will be singing\\npresently. Hi! child! what do you reckon to sing? Stand there and give me\\nthe opening line.\\n\\nTHE SON OF LAMACHUS. \"Glory to the young warriors....\"\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! leave off about your young warriors, you little wretch; we\\nare at peace and you are an idiot and a rascal.\\n\\nSON OF LAMACHUS. \"The skirmish begins, the hollow bucklers clash against\\neach other.\"[387]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Bucklers! Leave me in peace with your bucklers.\\n\\nSON OF LAMACHUS. \"And then there came groanings and shouts of victory.\"\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Groanings! ah! by Bacchus! look out for yourself, you cursed\\nsqualler, if you start wearying us again with your groanings and hollow\\nbucklers.\\n\\nSON OF LAMACHUS. Then what should I sing? Tell me what pleases you.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. \"\\'Tis thus they feasted on the flesh of oxen,\" or something\\nsimilar, as, for instance, \"Everything that could tickle the palate was\\nplaced on the table.\"\\n\\nSON OF LAMACHUS. \"\\'Tis thus they feasted on the flesh of oxen and, tired\\nof warfare, unharnessed their foaming steeds.\"\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. That\\'s splendid; tired of warfare, they seat themselves at\\ntable; sing, sing to us how they still go on eating after they are\\nsatiated.\\n\\nSON OF LAMACHUS. \"The meal over, they girded themselves ...\"\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. With good wine, no doubt?\\n\\nSON OF LAMACHUS. \"... with armour and rushed forth from the towers, and a\\nterrible shout arose.\"\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Get you gone, you little scapegrace, you and your battles! You\\nsing of nothing but warfare. Who is your father then?\\n\\nSON OF LAMACHUS. My father?\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Why yes, your father.\\n\\nSON OF LAMACHUS. I am Lamachus\\' son.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! oh! I could indeed have sworn, when I was listening to you,\\nthat you were the son of some warrior who dreams of nothing but wounds\\nand bruises, of some Boulomachus or Clausimachus;[388] go and sing your\\nplaguey songs to the spearmen.... Where is the son of Cleonymus? Sing me\\nsomething before going back to the feast. I am at least certain he will\\nnot sing of battles, for his father is far too careful a man.\\n\\nSON OF CLEONYMUS. \"An inhabitant of Saïs is parading with the spotless\\nshield which I regret to say I have thrown into a thicket.\"[389]\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Tell me, you little good-for-nothing, are you singing that for\\nyour father?\\n\\nSON or CLEONYMUS. \"But I saved my life.\"\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. And dishonoured your family. But let us go in; I am very\\ncertain, that being the son of such a father, you will never forget this\\nsong of the buckler. You, who remain to the feast, \\'tis your duty to\\ndevour dish after dish and not to ply empty jaws. Come, put heart into\\nthe work and eat with your mouths full. For, believe me, poor friends,\\nwhite teeth are useless furniture, if they chew nothing.\\n\\nCHORUS. Never fear; thanks all the same for your good advice.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. You, who yesterday were dying of hunger, come, stuff yourselves\\nwith this fine hare-stew; \\'tis not every day that we find cakes lying\\nneglected. Eat, eat, or I predict you will soon regret it.\\n\\nCHORUS. Silence! Keep silence! Here is the bride about to appear! Take\\nnuptial torches and let all rejoice and join in our songs. Then, when we\\nhave danced, clinked our cups and thrown Hyperbolus through the doorway,\\nwe will carry back all our farming tools to the fields and shall pray the\\ngods to give wealth to the Greeks and to cause us all to gather in an\\nabundant barley harvest, enjoy a noble vintage, to grant that we may\\nchoke with good figs, that our wives may prove fruitful, that in fact we\\nmay recover all our lost blessings, and that the sparkling fire may be\\nrestored to the hearth.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Come, wife, to the fields and seek, my beauty, to brighten and\\nenliven my nights. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus! oh! thrice happy man, who so well\\ndeserve your good fortune!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\\n\\nFIRST SEMI-CHORUS. What shall we do to her?\\n\\nSECOND SEMI-CHORUS. What shall we do to her?\\n\\nFIRST SEMI-CHORUS. We will gather her kisses.\\n\\nSECOND SEMI-CHORUS. We will gather her kisses.\\n\\nCHORUS. Come, comrades, we who are in the first row, let us pick up the\\nbridegroom and carry him in triumph. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\\n\\nCHORUS. You shall have a fine house, no cares and the finest of figs. Oh!\\nHymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\\n\\nCHORUS. The bridegroom\\'s fig is great and thick; the bride\\'s is very soft\\nand tender.\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. While eating and drinking deep draughts of wine, continue to\\nrepeat: Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\\n\\nTRYGAEUS. Farewell, farewell, my friends. All who come with me shall have\\ncakes galore.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFINIS OF \"PEACE\"', 'Acropolis, and finally within the precincts of the citadel.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nLYSISTRATA\\n\\n\\nLYSISTRATA (_alone_). Ah! if only they had been invited to a Bacchic\\nrevelling, or a feast of Pan or Aphrodité or Genetyllis,[390] why! the\\nstreets would have been impassable for the thronging tambourines! Now\\nthere\\'s never a woman here-ah! except my neighbour Calonicé, whom I see\\napproaching yonder.... Good day, Calonicé.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Good day, Lysistrata; but pray, why this dark, forbidding face,\\nmy dear? Believe me, you don\\'t look a bit pretty with those black\\nlowering brows.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Oh! Calonicé, my heart is on fire; I blush for our sex. Men\\n_will_ have it we are tricky and sly....\\n\\nCALONICÉ. And they are quite right, upon my word!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Yet, look you, when the women are summoned to meet for a\\nmatter of the last importance, they lie abed instead of coming.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Oh! they will come, my dear; but \\'tis not easy, you know, for\\nwomen to leave the house. One is busy pottering about her husband;\\nanother is getting the servant up; a third is putting her child asleep,\\nor washing the brat or feeding it.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. But I tell you, the business that calls them here is far and\\naway more urgent.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. And why _do_ you summon us, dear Lysistrata? What is it all\\nabout?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. About a big affair.[391]\\n\\nCALONICÉ. And is it thick too?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Yes indeed, both big and great.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. And we are not all on the spot!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Oh! if it were what you suppose, there would be never an\\nabsentee. No, no, it concerns a thing I have turned about and about this\\nway and that of many sleepless nights.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. It must be something mighty fine and subtle for you to have\\nturned it about so!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. So fine, it means just this, Greece saved by the women!\\n\\nCALONICÉ. By women! Why, its salvation hangs on a poor thread then!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Our country\\'s fortunes depend on us--it is with us to undo\\nutterly the Peloponnesians....\\n\\nCALONICÉ. That would be a noble deed truly!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. To exterminate the Boeotians to a man!\\n\\nCALONICÉ. But surely you would spare the eels.[392]\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. For Athens\\' sake I will never threaten so fell a doom; trust\\nme for that. However, if the Boeotian and Peloponnesian women join us,\\nGreece is saved.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. But how should women perform so wise and glorious an\\nachievement, we women who dwell in the retirement of the household, clad\\nin diaphanous garments of yellow silk and long flowing gowns, decked out\\nwith flowers and shod with dainty little slippers?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Nay, but those are the very sheet-anchors of our\\nsalvation--those yellow tunics, those scents and slippers, those\\ncosmetics and transparent robes.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. How so, pray?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. There is not a man will wield a lance against another ...\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Quick, I will get me a yellow tunic from the dyer\\'s.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. ... or want a shield.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. I\\'ll run and put on a flowing gown.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. ... or draw a sword.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. I\\'ll haste and buy a pair of slippers this instant.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Now tell me, would not the women have done best to come?\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Why, they should have _flown_ here!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Ah! my dear, you\\'ll see that like true Athenians, they will\\ndo everything too late[393].... Why, there\\'s not a woman come from the\\nshoreward parts, not one from Salamis.[394]\\n\\nCALONICÉ. But I know for certain they embarked at daybreak.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. And the dames from Acharnae![395] why, I thought they would\\nhave been the very first to arrive.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Theagenes wife[396] at any rate is sure to come; she has\\nactually been to consult Hecaté.... But look! here are some arrivals--and\\nthere are more behind. Ah! ha! now what countrywomen may they be?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. They are from Anagyra.[397]\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Yes! upon my word, \\'tis a levy _en masse_ of all the female\\npopulation of Anagyra!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Are we late, Lysistrata? Tell us, pray; what, not a word?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. I cannot say much for you, Myrrhiné! you have not bestirred\\nyourself overmuch for an affair of such urgency.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ I could not find my girdle in the dark. However, if the matter\\nis so pressing, here we are; so speak.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. No, but let us wait a moment more, till the women of Boeotia\\narrive and those from the Peloponnese.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ Yes, that is best.... Ah! here comes Lampito.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Good day, Lampito, dear friend from Lacedaemon. How well and\\nhandsome you look! what a rosy complexion! and how strong you seem; why,\\nyou could strangle a bull surely!\\n\\nLAMPITO. Yes, indeed, I really think I could. \\'Tis because I do\\ngymnastics and practise the kick dance.[398]\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. And what superb bosoms!\\n\\nLAMPITO. La! you are feeling me as if I were a beast for sacrifice.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. And this young woman, what countrywoman is she?\\n\\nLAMPITO. She is a noble lady from Boeotia.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Ah! my pretty Boeotian friend, you are as blooming as a\\ngarden.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Yes, on my word! and the garden is so prettily weeded too![399]\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. And who is this?\\n\\nLAMPITO. \\'Tis an honest woman, by my faith! she comes from Corinth.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Oh! honest, no doubt then--as honesty goes at Corinth.[400]\\n\\nLAMPITO. But who has called together this council of women, pray?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. I have.\\n\\nLAMPITO. Well then, tell us what you want of us.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. With pleasure, my dear.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. What is the most important business you wish to inform us\\nabout?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. I will tell you. But first answer me one question.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. What is that?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Don\\'t you feel sad and sorry because the fathers of your\\nchildren are far away from you with the army? For I\\'ll undertake, there\\nis not one of you whose husband is not abroad at this moment.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Mine has been the last five months in Thrace--looking after\\nEucrates.[401]\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. \\'Tis seven long months since mine left me for Pylos.[402]\\n\\nLAMPITO. As for mine, if he ever does return from service, he\\'s no sooner\\nback than he takes down his shield again and flies back to the wars.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. And not so much as the shadow of a lover! Since the day the\\nMilesians betrayed us, I have never once seen an eight-inch-long\\n_godemiche_ even, to be a leathern consolation to us poor widows.... Now\\ntell me, if I have discovered a means of ending the war, will you all\\nsecond me?\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Yes verily, by all the goddesses, I swear I will, though I have\\nto put my gown in pawn, and drink the money the same day.[403]\\n\\nCALONICÉ. And so will I, though I must be split in two like a flat-fish,\\nand have half myself removed.\\n\\nLAMPITO. And I too; why, to secure Peace, I would climb to the top of\\nMount Taygetus.[404]\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Then I will out with it at last, my mighty secret! Oh! sister\\nwomen, if we would compel our husbands to make peace, we must refrain....\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Refrain from what? tell us, tell us!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. But will you do it?\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. We will, we will, though we should die of it.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. We must refrain from the male organ altogether.... Nay, why\\ndo you turn your backs on me? Where are you going? So, you bite your\\nlips, and shake your heads, eh? Why these pale, sad looks? why these\\ntears? Come, will you do it--yes or no? Do you hesitate?\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. No, I will not do it; let the War go on.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. And you, my pretty flat-fish, who declared just now they\\nmight split you in two?\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Anything, anything but that! Bid me go through the fire, if you\\nwill; but to rob us of the sweetest thing in all the world, my dear, dear\\nLysistrata!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. And you?\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Yes, I agree with the others; I too would sooner go through the\\nfire.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Oh, wanton, vicious sex! the poets have done well to make\\ntragedies upon us; we are good for nothing then but love and\\nlewdness![405] But you, my dear, you from hardy Sparta, if _you_ join me,\\nall may yet be well; help me, second me, I conjure you.\\n\\nLAMPITO. \\'Tis a hard thing, by the two goddesses[406] it is! for a woman\\nto sleep alone without ever a standing weapon in her bed. But there,\\nPeace must come first.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Oh, my dear, my dearest, best friend, you are the only one\\ndeserving the name of woman!\\n\\nCALONICÉ. But if--which the gods forbid--we do refrain altogether from\\nwhat you say, should we get peace any sooner?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Of course we should, by the goddesses twain! We need only sit\\nindoors with painted cheeks, and meet our mates lightly clad in\\ntransparent gowns of Amorgos[407] silk, and with our \"mottes\" nicely\\nplucked smooth; then their tools will stand like mad and they will be\\nwild to lie with us. That will be the time to refuse, and they will\\nhasten to make peace, I am convinced of that!\\n\\nLAMPITO. Yes, just as Menelaus, when he saw Helen\\'s naked bosom, threw\\naway his sword, they say.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. But, poor devils, suppose our husbands go away and leave us.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Then, as Pherecrates says, we must \"flay a skinned dog,\"[408]\\nthat\\'s all.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Bah! these proverbs are all idle talk.... But if our husbands\\ndrag us by main force into the bedchamber?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Hold on to the door posts.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. But if they beat us?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Then yield to their wishes, but with a bad grace; there is no\\npleasure for them, when they do it by force. Besides, there are a\\nthousand ways of tormenting them. Never fear, they\\'ll soon tire of the\\ngame; there\\'s no satisfaction for a man, unless the woman shares it.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Very well, if you _will_ have it so, we agree.\\n\\nLAMPITO. For ourselves, no doubt we shall persuade our husbands to\\nconclude a fair and honest peace; but there is the Athenian populace, how\\nare we to cure these folk of their warlike frenzy?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Have no fear; we undertake to make our own people hear\\nreason.\\n\\nLAMPITO. Nay, impossible, so long as they have their trusty ships and the\\nvast treasures stored in the temple of Athené.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Ah! but we have seen to that; this very day the Acropolis\\nwill be in our hands. That is the task assigned to the older women; while\\nwe are here in council, they are going, under pretence of offering\\nsacrifice, to seize the citadel.\\n\\nLAMPITO. Well said indeed! so everything is going for the best.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Come, quick, Lampito, and let us bind ourselves by an\\ninviolable oath.\\n\\nLAMPITO. Recite the terms; we will swear to them.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. With pleasure. Where is our Usheress?[409] Now, what are you\\nstaring at, pray? Lay this shield on the earth before us, its hollow\\nupwards, and someone bring me the victim\\'s inwards.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Lysistrata, say, what oath are we to swear?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What oath? Why, in Aeschylus, they sacrifice a sheep, and\\nswear over a buckler;[410] we will do the same.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. No, Lysistrata, one cannot swear peace over a buckler, surely.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What other oath do you prefer?\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Let\\'s take a white horse, and sacrifice it, and swear on its\\nentrails.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. But where get a white horse from?\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Well, what oath shall we take then?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Listen to me. Let\\'s set a great black bowl on the ground;\\nlet\\'s sacrifice a skin of Thasian[411] wine into it, and take oath not to\\nadd one single drop of water.\\n\\nLAMPITO. Ah! that\\'s an oath pleases me more than I can say.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Let them bring me a bowl and a skin of wine.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Ah! my dears, what a noble big bowl! what a delight \\'twill be\\nto empty it!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Set the bowl down on the ground, and lay your hands on the\\nvictim.... Almighty goddess, Persuasion, and thou, bowl, boon comrade of\\njoy and merriment, receive this our sacrifice, and be propitious to us\\npoor women!\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Oh! the fine red blood! how well it flows!\\n\\nLAMPITO. And what a delicious savour, by the goddesses twain!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Now, my dears, let me swear first, if you please.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. No, by the goddess of love, let us decide that by lot.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Come then, Lampito, and all of you, put your hands to the\\nbowl; and do you, Calonicé, repeat in the name of all the solemn terms I\\nam going to recite. Then you must all swear, and pledge yourselves by the\\nsame promises.--\"_I will have naught to do whether with lover or\\nhusband...._\"\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _I will have naught to do whether with lover or husband...._\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _Albeit he come to me with stiff and standing tool...._\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _Albeit he come to me with stiff and standing tool...._ Oh!\\nLysistrata, I cannot bear it!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _I will live at home in perfect chastity...._\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _I will live at home in perfect chastity...._\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _Beautifully dressed and wearing a saffron-coloured gown...._\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _Beautifully dressed and wearing a saffron-coloured gown...._\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _To the end I may inspire my husband with the most ardent\\nlongings._\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _To the end I may inspire my husband with the most ardent\\nlongings._\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _Never will I give myself voluntarily...._\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _Never will I give myself voluntarily...._\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _And if he has me by force...._\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _And if he has me by force...._\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _I will be cold as ice, and never stir a limb...._\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _I will be cold as ice, and never stir a limb...._\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _I will not lift my legs in air...._\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _I will not lift my legs in air...._\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _Nor will I crouch with bottom upraised, like carven lions on\\na knife-handle_.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _Nor will I crouch with bottom upraised, like carven lions on a\\nknife-handle_.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _An if I keep my oath, may I be suffered to drink of this\\nwine._\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _An if I keep my oath, may I be suffered to drink of this\\nwine_.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. _But if I break it, let my bowl be filled with water_.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. _But if I break it, let my bowl be filled with water_.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Will ye all take this oath?\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Yes, yes!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Then lo! I immolate the victim. (_She drinks._)\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Enough, enough, my dear; now let us all drink in turn to cement\\nour friendship.\\n\\nLAMPITO. Hark! what do those cries mean?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. \\'Tis what I was telling you; the women have just occupied the\\nAcropolis. So now, Lampito, do you return to Sparta to organize the plot,\\nwhile your comrades here remain as hostages. For ourselves, let us away\\nto join the rest in the citadel, and let us push the bolts well home.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. But don\\'t you think the men will march up against us?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. I laugh at them. Neither threats nor flames shall force our\\ndoors; they shall open only on the conditions I have named.\\n\\nCALONICÉ. Yes, yes, by the goddess of love! let us keep up our old-time\\nrepute for obstinacy and spite.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN.[412] Go easy, Draces, go easy; why, your shoulder is\\nall chafed by these plaguey heavy olive stocks. But forward still,\\nforward, man, as needs must. What unlooked-for things do happen, to be\\nsure, in a long life! Ah! Strymodorus, who would ever have thought it?\\nHere we have the women, who used, for our misfortune, to eat our bread\\nand live in our houses, daring nowadays to lay hands on the holy image of\\nthe goddess, to seize the Acropolis and draw bars and bolts to keep any\\nfrom entering! Come, Philurgus man, let\\'s hurry thither; let\\'s lay our\\nfaggots all about the citadel, and on the blazing pile burn with our\\nhands these vile conspiratresses, one and all--and Lycon\\'s wife,\\nLysistrata, first and foremost! Nay, by Demeter, never will I let \\'em\\nlaugh at me, whiles I have a breath left in my body. Cleomenes\\nhimself,[413] the first who ever seized our citadel, had to quit it to\\nhis sore dishonour; spite his Lacedaemonian pride, he had to deliver me\\nup his arms and slink off with a single garment to his back. My word! but\\nhe was filthy and ragged! and what an unkempt beard, to be sure! He had\\nnot had a bath for six long years! Oh! but that was a mighty siege! Our\\nmen were ranged seventeen deep before the gate, and never left their\\nposts, even to sleep. These women, these enemies of Euripides and all the\\ngods, shall I do nothing to hinder their inordinate insolence? else let\\nthem tear down my trophies of Marathon. But look ye, to finish our\\ntoilsome climb, we have only this last steep bit left to mount. Verily\\n\\'tis no easy job without beasts of burden, and how these logs do bruise\\nmy shoulder! Still let us on, and blow up our fire and see it does not go\\nout just as we reach our destination. Phew! phew! (_blows the fire_). Oh!\\ndear! what a dreadful smoke! it bites my eyes like a mad dog. It is\\nLemnos[414] fire for sure, or it would never devour my eyelids like this.\\nCome on, Laches, let\\'s hurry, let\\'s bring succour to the goddess; it\\'s\\nnow or never! Phew! phew! (_blows the fire_). Oh! dear! what a confounded\\nsmoke!--There now, there\\'s our fire all bright and burning, thank the\\ngods! Now, why not first put down our loads here, then take a\\nvine-branch, light it at the brazier and hurl it at the gate by way of\\nbattering-ram? If they don\\'t answer our summons by pulling back the\\nbolts, then we set fire to the woodwork, and the smoke will choke \\'em. Ye\\ngods! what a smoke! Pfaugh! Is there never a Samos general will help me\\nunload my burden?[415]--Ah! it shall not gall my shoulder any more.\\n(_Tosses down his wood._) Come, brazier, do your duty, make the embers\\nflare, that I may kindle a brand; I want to be the first to hurl one. Aid\\nme, heavenly Victory; let us punish for their insolent audacity the women\\nwho have seized our citadel, and may we raise a trophy of triumph for\\nsuccess!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN.[416] Oh! my dears, methinks I see fire and smoke; can it\\nbe a conflagration? Let us hurry all we can. Fly, fly, Nicodicé, ere\\nCalycé and Crityllé perish in the fire, or are stifled in the smoke\\nraised by these accursed old men and their pitiless laws. But, great\\ngods, can it be I come too late? Rising at dawn, I had the utmost trouble\\nto fill this vessel at the fountain. Oh! what a crowd there was, and what\\na din! What a rattling of water-pots! Servants and slave-girls pushed and\\nthronged me! However, here I have it full at last; and I am running to\\ncarry the water to my fellow townswomen, whom our foes are plotting to\\nburn alive. News has been brought us that a company of old, doddering\\ngreybeards, loaded with enormous faggots, as if they wanted to heat a\\nfurnace, have taken the field, vomiting dreadful threats, crying that\\nthey must reduce to ashes these horrible women. Suffer them not, oh!\\ngoddess, but, of thy grace, may I see Athens and Greece cured of their\\nwarlike folly. \\'Tis to this end, oh! thou guardian deity of our city,\\ngoddess of the golden crest, that they have seized thy sanctuary. Be\\ntheir friend and ally, Athené, and if any man hurl against them lighted\\nfirebrands, aid us to carry water to extinguish them.\\n\\nSTRATYLLIS. Let me be, I say. Oh! oh! (_She calls for help._)\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. What is this I see, ye wretched old men? Honest and\\npious folk ye cannot be who act so vilely.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah, ha! here\\'s something new! a swarm of women stand\\nposted outside to defend the gates!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Ah! ah! we frighten you, do we; we seem a mighty host,\\nyet you do not see the ten-thousandth part of our sex.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ho, Phaedrias! shall we stop their cackle? Suppose one\\nof us were to break a stick across their backs, eh?\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Let us set down our water-pots on the ground, to be out\\nof the way, if they should dare to offer us violence.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Let someone knock out two or three teeth for them, as\\nthey did to Bupalus;[417] they won\\'t talk so loud then.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Come on then; I wait you with unflinching foot, and I\\nwill snap off your testicles like a bitch.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Silence! ere my stick has cut short your days.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Now, just you dare to touch Stratyllis with the tip of\\nyour finger!\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. And if I batter you to pieces with my fists, what will\\nyou do?\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I will tear out your lungs and entrails with my teeth.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Oh! what a clever poet is Euripides! how well he says\\nthat woman is the most shameless of animals.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Let\\'s pick up our water-jars again, Rhodippé.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah! accursed harlot, what do you mean to do here with\\nyour water?\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. And you, old death-in-life, with your fire? Is it to\\ncremate yourself?\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. I am going to build you a pyre to roast your female\\nfriends upon.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. And I,--I am going to put out your fire.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. You put out my fire--you!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Yes, you shall soon see.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. I don\\'t know what prevents me from roasting you with\\nthis torch.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I am getting you a bath ready to clean off the filth.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. A bath for me, you dirty slut, you!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Yes, indeed, a nuptial bath--he, he!\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Do you hear that? What insolence!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I am a free woman, I tell you.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. I will make you hold your tongue, never fear!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Ah, ha! you shall never sit more amongst the\\nheliasts.[418]\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Burn off her hair for her!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Water, do your office! (_The women pitch the water in\\ntheir water-pots over the old men._)\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Was it hot?\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Hot, great gods! Enough, enough!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I\\'m watering you, to make you bloom afresh.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Alas! I am too dry! Ah, me! how I am trembling with\\ncold!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. These women, have they made din enough, I wonder, with their\\ntambourines? bewept Adonis enough upon their terraces?[419] I was\\nlistening to the speeches last assembly day,[420] and Demostratus,[421]\\nwhom heaven confound! was saying we must all go over to Sicily--and lo!\\nhis wife was dancing round repeating: Alas! alas! Adonis, woe is me for\\nAdonis!\\n\\nDemostratus was saying we must levy hoplites at Zacynthus[422]--and lo!\\nhis wife, more than half drunk, was screaming on the house-roof: \"Weep,\\nweep for Adonis!\"--while that infamous _Mad Ox_[423] was bellowing away\\non his side.--Do ye not blush, ye women, for your wild and uproarious\\ndoings?\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. But you don\\'t know all their effrontery yet! They\\nabused and insulted us; then soused us with the water in their\\nwater-pots, and have set us wringing out our clothes, for all the world\\nas if we had bepissed ourselves.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. And \\'tis well done too, by Poseidon! We men must share the\\nblame of their ill conduct; it is we who teach them to love riot and\\ndissoluteness and sow the seeds of wickedness in their hearts. You see a\\nhusband go into a shop: \"Look you, jeweller,\" says he, \"you remember the\\nnecklace you made for my wife. Well, t\\'other evening, when she was\\ndancing, the catch came open. Now, I am bound to start for Salamis; will\\nyou make it convenient to go up to-night to make her fastening secure?\"\\nAnother will go to a cobbler, a great, strong fellow, with a great, long\\ntool, and tell him: \"The strap of one of my wife\\'s sandals presses her\\nlittle toe, which is extremely sensitive; come in about midday to supple\\nthe thing and stretch it.\" Now see the results. Take my own case--as a\\nMagistrate I have enlisted rowers; I want money to pay \\'em, and lo! the\\nwomen clap to the door in my face.[424] But why do we stand here with\\narms crossed? Bring me a crowbar; I\\'ll chastise their insolence!--Ho!\\nthere, my fine fellow! (_addressing one of his attendant officers_) what\\nare you gaping at the crows about? looking for a tavern, I suppose, eh?\\nCome, crowbars here, and force open the gates. I will put a hand to the\\nwork myself.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. No need to force the gates; I am coming out--here I am. And\\nwhy bolts and bars? What we want here is not bolts and bars and locks,\\nbut common sense.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Really, my fine lady! Where is my officer? I want him to tie\\nthat woman\\'s hands behind her back.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. By Artemis, the virgin goddess! if he touches me with the tip\\nof his finger, officer of the public peace though he be, let him look out\\nfor himself!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE (_to the officer_). How now, are you afraid? Seize her, I tell\\nyou, round the body. Two of you at her, and have done with it!\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. By Pandrosos! if you lay a hand on her, I\\'ll trample you\\nunderfoot till you shit your guts!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Oh, there! my guts! Where is my other officer? Bind that minx\\nfirst, who speaks so prettily!\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. By Phoebé, if you touch her with one finger, you\\'d better\\ncall quick for a surgeon!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. What do you mean? Officer, where are you got to? Lay hold of\\nher. Oh! but I\\'m going to stop your foolishness for you all!\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. By the Tauric Artemis, if you go near her, I\\'ll pull out\\nyour hair, scream as you like.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Ah! miserable man that I am! My own officers desert me. What\\nho! are we to let ourselves be bested by a mob of women? Ho! Scythians\\nmine, close up your ranks, and forward!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. By the holy goddesses! you\\'ll have to make acquaintance with\\nfour companies of women, ready for the fray and well armed to boot.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Forward, Scythians, and bind them!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Forward, my gallant companions; march forth, ye vendors of\\ngrain and eggs, garlic and vegetables, keepers of taverns and bakeries,\\nwrench and strike and tear; come, a torrent of invective and insult!\\n(_They beat the officers._) Enough, enough! now retire, never rob the\\nvanquished!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Here\\'s a fine exploit for my officers!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Ah, ha! so you thought you had only to do with a set of\\nslave-women! you did not know the ardour that fills the bosom of\\nfree-born dames.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Ardour! yes, by Apollo, ardour enough--especially for the\\nwine-cup!\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Sir, sir! what use of words? they are of no avail with\\nwild beasts of this sort. Don\\'t you know how they have just washed us\\ndown--and with no very fragrant soap!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. What would you have? You should never have laid rash\\nhands on us. If you start afresh, I\\'ll knock your eyes out. My delight is\\nto stay at home as coy as a young maid, without hurting anybody or moving\\nany more than a milestone; but \\'ware the wasps, if you go stirring up the\\nwasps\\' nest!\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah! great gods! how get the better of these ferocious\\ncreatures? \\'tis past all bearing! But come, let us try to find out the\\nreason of the dreadful scourge. With what end in view have they seized\\nthe citadel of Cranaus,[425] the sacred shrine that is raised upon the\\ninaccessible rock of the Acropolis? Question them; be cautious and not\\ntoo credulous. \\'Twould be culpable negligence not to pierce the mystery,\\nif we may.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE (_addressing the women_). I would ask you first why ye have\\nbarred our gates.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. To seize the treasury; no more money, no more war.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Then money is the cause of the War?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. And of all our troubles. \\'Twas to find occasion to steal that\\nPisander[426] and all the other agitators were for ever raising\\nrevolutions. Well and good! but they\\'ll never get another drachma here.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. What do you propose to do then, pray?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. You ask me that! Why, we propose to administer the treasury\\nourselves.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. _You_ do?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What is there in that to surprise you? Do we not administer\\nthe budget of household expenses?\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. But that is not the same thing.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA How so--not the same thing?\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. It is the treasury supplies the expenses of the War.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. That\\'s our first principle--no War!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. What! and the safety of the city?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. We will provide for that.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE You?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA Yes, just we.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. What a sorry business!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Yes, we\\'re going to save you, whether you will or no.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Oh! the impudence of the creatures!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. You seem annoyed! but there, you\\'ve got to come to it.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. But \\'tis the very height of iniquity!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. We\\'re going to save you, my man.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. But if I don\\'t want to be saved?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Why, all the more reason!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. But what a notion, to concern yourselves with questions of\\nPeace and War!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. We will explain our idea.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Out with it then; quick, or ... (_threatening her_).\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Listen, and never a movement, please!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Oh! it is too much for me! I cannot keep my temper!\\n\\nA WOMAN. Then look out for yourself; you have more to fear than we have.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Stop your croaking, old crow, you! (_To Lysistrata._) Now\\nyou, say your say.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Willingly. All the long time the War has lasted, we have\\nendured in modest silence all you men did; we never allowed ourselves to\\nopen our lips. We were far from satisfied, for we knew how things were\\ngoing; often in our homes we would hear you discussing, upside down and\\ninside out, some important turn of affairs. Then with sad hearts, but\\nsmiling lips, we would ask you: Well, in to-day\\'s Assembly did they vote\\nPeace?--But, \"Mind your own business!\" the husband would growl, \"Hold\\nyour tongue, do!\" And I would say no more.\\n\\nA WOMAN. I would not have held my tongue though, not I!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. You would have been reduced to silence by blows then.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Well, for my part, I would say no more. But presently I would\\ncome to know you had arrived at some fresh decision more fatally foolish\\nthan ever. \"Ah! my dear man,\" I would say, \"what madness next!\" But he\\nwould only look at me askance and say: \"Just weave your web, do; else\\nyour cheeks will smart for hours. War is men\\'s business!\"\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Bravo! well said indeed!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. How now, wretched man? not to let us contend against your\\nfollies, was bad enough! But presently we heard you asking out loud in\\nthe open street: \"Is there never a man left in Athens?\" and, \"No, not\\none, not one,\" you were assured in reply. Then, then we made up our minds\\nwithout more delay to make common cause to save Greece. Open your ears to\\nour wise counsels and hold your tongues, and we may yet put things on a\\nbetter footing.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. _You_ put things indeed! Oh! \\'tis too much! The insolence of\\nthe creatures! Silence, I say.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Silence yourself!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. May I die a thousand deaths ere I obey one who wears a veil!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. If that\\'s all that troubles you, here, take my veil, wrap it\\nround your head, and hold your tongue. Then take this basket; put on a\\ngirdle, card wool, munch beans. The War shall be women\\'s business.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Lay aside your water-pots, we will guard them, we will\\nhelp our friends and companions. For myself, I will never weary of the\\ndance; my knees will never grow stiff with fatigue. I will brave\\neverything with my dear allies, on whom Nature has lavished virtue,\\ngrace, boldness, cleverness, and whose wisely directed energy is going to\\nsave the State. Oh! my good, gallant Lysistrata, and all my friends, be\\never like a bundle of nettles; never let your anger slacken; the winds of\\nfortune blow our way.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. May gentle Love and the sweet Cyprian Queen shower seductive\\ncharms on our bosoms and all our person. If only we may stir so amorous a\\nlust among the men that their tools stand stiff as sticks, we shall\\nindeed deserve the name of peace-makers among the Greeks.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. How will that be, pray?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. To begin with, we shall not see you any more running like mad\\nfellows to the Market holding lance in fist.\\n\\nA WOMAN. That will be something gained, anyway, by the Paphian goddess,\\nit will!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Now we see \\'em, mixed up with saucepans and kitchen stuff,\\narmed to the teeth, looking like wild Corybantes![427]\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Why, of course; that\\'s how brave men should do.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Oh! but what a funny sight, to behold a man wearing a\\nGorgon\\'s-head buckler coming along to buy fish!\\n\\nA WOMAN. \\'Tother day in the Market I saw a phylarch[428] with flowing\\nringlets; he was a-horseback, and was pouring into his helmet the broth\\nhe had just bought at an old dame\\'s stall. There was a Thracian warrior\\ntoo, who was brandishing his lance like Tereus in the play;[429] he had\\nscared a good woman selling figs into a perfect panic, and was gobbling\\nup all her ripest fruit.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. And how, pray, would you propose to restore peace and order\\nin all the countries of Greece?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. \\'Tis the easiest thing in the world!\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Come, tell us how; I am curious to know.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. When we are winding thread, and it is tangled, we pass the\\nspool across and through the skein, now this way, now that way; even so,\\nto finish off the War, we shall send embassies hither and thither and\\neverywhere, to disentangle matters.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. And \\'tis with your yarn, and your skeins, and your spools,\\nyou think to appease so many bitter enmities, you silly women?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. If only you had common sense, you would always do in politics\\nthe same as we do with our yarn.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Come, how is that, eh?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. First we wash the yarn to separate the grease and filth; do\\nthe same with all bad citizens, sort them out and drive them forth with\\nrods--\\'tis the refuse of the city. Then for all such as come crowding up\\nin search of employments and offices, we must card them thoroughly; then,\\nto bring them all to the same standard, pitch them pell-mell into the\\nsame basket, resident aliens or no, allies, debtors to the State, all\\nmixed up together. Then as for our Colonies, you must think of them as so\\nmany isolated hanks; find the ends of the separate threads, draw them to\\na centre here, wind them into one, make one great hank of the lot, out of\\nwhich the Public can weave itself a good, stout tunic.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Is it not a sin and a shame to see them carding and winding\\nthe State, these women who have neither art nor part in the burdens of\\nthe War?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What! wretched man! why, \\'tis a far heavier burden to us than\\nto you. In the first place, we bear sons who go off to fight far away\\nfrom Athens.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Enough said! do not recall sad and sorry memories![430]\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Then secondly, instead of enjoying the pleasures of love and\\nmaking the best of our youth and beauty, we are left to languish far from\\nour husbands, who are all with the army. But say no more of ourselves;\\nwhat afflicts me is to see our girls growing old in lonely grief.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Don\\'t the men grow old too?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. That is not the same thing. When the soldier returns from the\\nwars, even though he has white hair, he very soon finds a young wife. But\\na woman has only one summer; if she does not make hay while the sun\\nshines, no one will afterwards have anything to say to her, and she\\nspends her days consulting oracles, that never send her a husband.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. But the old man who can still erect his organ ...\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. But you, why don\\'t you get done with it and die? You are\\nrich; go buy yourself a bier, and I will knead you a honey-cake for\\nCerberus. Here, take this garland. (_Drenching him with water._)\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. And this one too. (_Drenching him with water._)\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. And these fillets. (_Drenching him with water._)\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What do you lack more? Step aboard the boat; Charon is\\nwaiting for you, you\\'re keeping him from pushing off.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. To treat me so scurvily! What an insult! I will go show\\nmyself to my fellow-magistrates just as I am.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What! are you blaming us for not having exposed you according\\nto custom?[431] Nay, console yourself; we will not fail to offer up the\\nthird-day sacrifice for you, first thing in the morning.[432]\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Awake, friends of freedom; let us hold ourselves aye\\nready to act. I suspect a mighty peril; I foresee another Tyranny like\\nHippias\\'.[433] I am sore afraid the Laconians assembled here with\\nCleisthenes have, by a stratagem of war, stirred up these women, enemies\\nof the gods, to seize upon our treasury and the funds whereby I\\nlived.[434] Is it not a sin and a shame for them to interfere in advising\\nthe citizens, to prate of shields and lances, and to ally themselves with\\nLaconians, fellows I trust no more than I would so many famished wolves?\\nThe whole thing, my friends, is nothing else but an attempt to\\nre-establish Tyranny. But I will never submit; I will be on my guard for\\nthe future; I will always carry a blade hidden under myrtle boughs; I\\nwill post myself in the Public Square under arms, shoulder to shoulder\\nwith Aristogiton;[435] and now, to make a start, I must just break a few\\nof that cursed old jade\\'s teeth yonder.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Nay, never play the brave man, else when you go back\\nhome, your own mother won\\'t know you. But, dear friends and allies, first\\nlet us lay our burdens down; then, citizens all, hear what I have to say.\\nI have useful counsel to give our city, which deserves it well at my\\nhands for the brilliant distinctions it has lavished on my girlhood. At\\nseven years of age, I was bearer of the sacred vessels; at ten, I pounded\\nbarley for the altar of Athené; next, clad in a robe of yellow silk, I\\nwas _little bear_ to Artemis at the Brauronia;[436] presently, grown a\\ntall, handsome maiden, they put a necklace of dried figs about my neck,\\nand I was Basket-Bearer.[437] So surely I am bound to give my best advice\\nto Athens. What matters that I was born a woman, if I can cure your\\nmisfortunes? I pay my share of tolls and taxes, by giving men to the\\nState. But you, you miserable greybeards, you contribute nothing to the\\npublic charges; on the contrary, you have wasted the treasure of our\\nforefathers, as it was called, the treasure amassed in the days of the\\nPersian Wars.[438] You pay nothing at all in return; and into the bargain\\nyou endanger our lives and liberties by your mistakes. Have you one word\\nto say for yourselves? ... Ah! don\\'t irritate me, you there, or I\\'ll lay\\nmy slipper across your jaws; and it\\'s pretty heavy.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Outrage upon outrage! things are going from bad to\\nworse. Let us punish the minxes, every one of us that has a man\\'s\\nappendages to boast of. Come, off with our tunics, for a man must savour\\nof manhood; come, my friends, let us strip naked from head to foot.\\nCourage, I say, we who in our day garrisoned Lipsydrion;[439] let us be\\nyoung again, and shake off eld. If we give them the least hold over us,\\n\\'tis all up! their audacity will know no bounds! We shall see them\\nbuilding ships, and fighting sea-fights, like Artemisia;[440] nay, if\\nthey want to mount and ride as cavalry, we had best cashier the knights,\\nfor indeed women excel in riding, and have a fine, firm seat for the\\ngallop.[441] Just think of all those squadrons of Amazons Micon has\\npainted for us engaged in hand-to-hand combat with men.[442] Come then,\\nwe must e\\'en fit collars to all these willing necks.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. By the blessed goddesses, if you anger me, I will let\\nloose the beast of my evil passions, and a very hailstorm of blows will\\nset you yelling for help. Come, dames, off tunics, and quick\\'s the word;\\nwomen must scent the savour of women in the throes of passion.... Now\\njust you dare to measure strength with me, old greybeard, and I warrant\\nyou you\\'ll never eat garlic or black beans more. No, not a word! my anger\\nis at boiling point, and I\\'ll do with you what the beetle did with the\\neagle\\'s eggs.[443] I laugh at your threats, so long as I have on my side\\nLampito here, and the noble Theban, my dear Ismenia.... Pass decree on\\ndecree, you can do us no hurt, you wretch abhorred of all your fellows.\\nWhy, only yesterday, on occasion of the feast of Hecaté, I asked my\\nneighbours of Boeotia for one of their daughters for whom my girls have a\\nlively liking--a fine, fat eel to wit; and if they did not refuse, all\\nalong of your silly decrees! We shall never cease to suffer the like,\\ntill someone gives you a neat trip-up and breaks your neck for you!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN (_addressing Lysistrata_). You, Lysistrata, you who are\\nleader of our glorious enterprise, why do I see you coming towards me\\nwith so gloomy an air?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. \\'Tis the behaviour of these naughty women, \\'tis the female\\nheart and female weakness so discourages me.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Tell us, tell us, what is it?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. I only tell the simple truth.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. What has happened so disconcerting; come, tell your\\nfriends.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Oh! the thing is so hard to tell--yet so impossible to\\nconceal.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Nay, never seek to hide any ill that has befallen our\\ncause.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. To blurt it out in a word--we are in heat!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Oh! Zeus, oh! Zeus!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What use calling upon Zeus? The thing is even as I say. I\\ncannot stop them any longer from lusting after the men. They are all for\\ndeserting. The first I caught was slipping out by the postern gate near\\nthe cave of Pan; another was letting herself down by a rope and pulley; a\\nthird was busy preparing her escape; while a fourth, perched on a bird\\'s\\nback, was just taking wing for Orsilochus\\' house,[444] when I seized her\\nby the hair. One and all, they are inventing excuses to be off home.\\nLook! there goes one, trying to get out! Halloa there! whither away so\\nfast?\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. I want to go home; I have some Miletus wool in the house,\\nwhich is getting all eaten up by the worms.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Bah! you and your worms! go back, I say!\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. I will return immediately, I swear I will by the two\\ngoddesses! I only have just to spread it out on the bed.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. You shall not do anything of the kind! I say, you shall not\\ngo.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. Must I leave my wool to spoil then?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Yes, if need be.\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. Unhappy woman that I am! Alas for my flax! I\\'ve left it at\\nhome unstript!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. So, here\\'s another trying to escape to go home and strip her\\nflax forsooth!\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. Oh! I swear by the goddess of light, the instant I have put\\nit in condition I will come straight back.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. You shall do nothing of the kind! If once you began, others\\nwould want to follow suit.\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. Oh! goddess divine, Ilithyia, patroness of women in labour,\\nstay, stay the birth, till I have reached a spot less hallowed than\\nAthene\\'s Mount!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What mean you by these silly tales?\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. I am going to have a child--now, this minute.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. But you were not pregnant yesterday!\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. Well, I am to-day. Oh! let me go in search of the midwife,\\nLysistrata, quick, quick!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What is this fable you are telling me? Ah! what have you got\\nthere so hard?\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. A male child.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. No, no, by Aphrodité! nothing of the sort! Why, it feels like\\nsomething hollow--a pot or a kettle. Oh! you baggage, if you have not got\\nthe sacred helmet of Pallas--and you said you were with child!\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. And so I am, by Zeus, I am!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Then why this helmet, pray?\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. For fear my pains should seize me in the Acropolis; I mean\\nto lay my eggs in this helmet, as the doves do.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Excuses and pretences every word! the thing\\'s as clear as\\ndaylight. Anyway, you must stay here now till the fifth day, your day of\\npurification.\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. I cannot sleep any more in the Acropolis, now I have seen\\nthe snake that guards the Temple.\\n\\nFOURTH WOMAN. Ah! and those confounded owls with their dismal hooting! I\\ncannot get a wink of rest, and I\\'m just dying of fatigue.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. You wicked women, have done with your falsehoods! You want\\nyour husbands, that\\'s plain enough. But don\\'t you think they want you\\njust as badly? They are spending dreadful nights, oh! I know that well\\nenough. But hold out, my dears, hold out! A little more patience, and the\\nvictory will be ours. An Oracle promises us success, if only we remain\\nunited. Shall I repeat the words?\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. Yes, tell us what the Oracle declares.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Silence then! Now--\"Whenas the swallows, fleeing before the\\nhoopoes, shall have all flocked together in one place, and shall refrain\\nthem from all amorous commerce, then will be the end of all the ills of\\nlife; yea, and Zeus, which doth thunder in the skies, shall set above\\nwhat was erst below....\"\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. What! shall the men be underneath?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. \"But if dissension do arise among the swallows, and they take\\nwing from the holy Temple, \\'twill be said there is never a more wanton\\nbird in all the world.\"\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Ye gods! the prophecy is clear. Nay, never let us be\\ncast down by calamity! let us be brave to bear, and go back to our posts.\\n\\'Twere shameful indeed not to trust the promises of the Oracle.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. I want to tell you a fable they used to relate to me\\nwhen I was a little boy. This is it: Once upon a time there was a young\\nman called Melanion, who hated the thought of marriage so sorely that he\\nfled away to the wilds. So he dwelt in the mountains, wove himself nets,\\nkept a dog and caught hares. He never, never came back, he had such a\\nhorror of women. As chaste as Melanion,[445] we loathe the jades just as\\nmuch as he did.\\n\\nAN OLD MAN. You dear old woman, I would fain kiss you.\\n\\nA WOMAN. I will set you crying without onions.\\n\\nOLD MAN. ... And give you a sound kicking.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Ah, ha! what a dense forest you have there! (_Pointing._)\\n\\nOLD MAN. So was Myronides one of the best-bearded of men o\\' this side;\\nhis backside was all black, and he terrified his enemies as much as\\nPhormio.[446]\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I want to tell you a fable too, to match yours about\\nMelanion. Once there was a certain man called Timon,[447] a tough\\ncustomer, and a whimsical, a true son of the Furies, with a face that\\nseemed to glare out of a thorn-bush. He withdrew from the world because\\nhe couldn\\'t abide bad men, after vomiting a thousand curses at \\'em. He\\nhad a holy horror of ill-conditioned fellows, but he was mighty tender\\ntowards women.\\n\\nA WOMAN. Suppose I up and broke your jaw for you!\\n\\nAN OLD MAN. I am not a bit afraid of you.\\n\\nA WOMAN. Suppose I let fly a good kick at you?\\n\\nOLD MAN. I should see your backside then.\\n\\nWOMAN. You would see that, for all my age, it is very well attended to,\\nand all fresh singed smooth.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Ho there! come quick, come quick!\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. What is it? Why these cries?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. A man! a man! I see him approaching all afire with the flames\\nof love. Oh! divine Queen of Cyprus, Paphos and Cythera, I pray you still\\nbe propitious to our emprise.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. Where is he, this unknown foe?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Yonder--beside the Temple of Demeter.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. Yes, indeed, I see him; but who is it?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Look, look! does any of you recognize him?\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. I do, I do! \\'tis my husband Cinesias.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. To work then! Be it your task to inflame and torture and\\ntorment him. Seductions, caresses, provocations, refusals, try every\\nmeans! Grant every favour,--always excepting what is forbidden by our\\noath on the wine-bowl.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Have no fear, I undertake the work.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Well, I will stay here to help you cajole the man and set his\\npassions aflame. The rest of you, withdraw.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Alas! alas! how I am tortured by spasm and rigid convulsion!\\nOh! I am racked on the wheel!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Who is this that dares to pass our lines?\\n\\nCINESIAS. It is I.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What, a man?\\n\\nCINESIAS. Yes, no doubt about it, a man!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Begone!\\n\\nCINESIAS. But who are you that thus repulses me?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. The sentinel of the day.\\n\\nCINESIAS. By all the gods, call Myrrhiné hither.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Call Myrrhiné hither, quotha? And pray, who are you?\\n\\nCINESIAS. I am her husband, Cinesias, son of Peon.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Ah! good day, my dear friend. Your name is not unknown\\namongst us. Your wife has it for ever on her lips; and she never touches\\nan egg or an apple without saying: \"\\'Twill be for Cinesias.\"\\n\\nCINESIAS. Really and truly?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Yes, indeed, by Aphrodité! And if we fall to talking of men,\\nquick your wife declares: \"Oh! all the rest, they\\'re good for nothing\\ncompared with Cinesias.\"\\n\\nCINESIAS. Oh! I beseech you, go and call her to me.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. And what will you give me for my trouble?\\n\\nCINESIAS.\\n\\nThis, if you like (_handling his tool_). I will give you what I have\\nthere!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Well, well, I will tell her to come.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Quick, oh! be quick! Life has no more charms for me since she\\nleft my house. I am sad, sad, when I go indoors; it all seems so empty;\\nmy victuals have lost their savour. Desire is eating out my heart!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. I love him, oh! I love him; but he won\\'t let himself be loved.\\nNo! I shall not come.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Myrrhiné, my little darling Myrrhiné, what are you saying? Come\\ndown to me quick.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. No indeed, not I.\\n\\nCINESIAS. I call you, Myrrhiné, Myrrhiné; will you not come?\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Why should you call me? You do not want me.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Not want you! Why, my weapon stands stiff with desire!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Good-bye.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Oh! Myrrhiné, Myrrhiné, in our child\\'s name, hear me; at any\\nrate hear the child! Little lad, call your mother.\\n\\nCHILD. Mammy, mammy, mammy!\\n\\nCINESIAS. There, listen! Don\\'t you pity the poor child? It\\'s six days now\\nyou\\'ve never washed and never fed the child.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Poor darling, your father takes mighty little care of you!\\n\\nCINESIAS. Come down, dearest, come down for the child\\'s sake.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Ah! what a thing it is to be a mother! Well, well, we must come\\ndown, I suppose.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Why, how much younger and prettier she looks! And how she looks\\nat me so lovingly! Her cruelty and scorn only redouble my passion.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. You are as sweet as your father is provoking! Let me kiss you,\\nmy treasure, mother\\'s darling!\\n\\nCINESIAS. Ah! what a bad thing it is to let yourself be led away by other\\nwomen! Why give me such pain and suffering, and yourself into the\\nbargain?\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Hands off, sir!\\n\\nCINESIAS. Everything is going to rack and ruin in the house.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. I don\\'t care.\\n\\nCINESIAS. But your web that\\'s all being pecked to pieces by the cocks and\\nhens, don\\'t you care for that?\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Precious little.\\n\\nCINESIAS. And Aphrodite, whose mysteries you have not celebrated for so\\nlong? Oh! won\\'t you come back home?\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. No, at least, not till a sound Treaty put an end to the War.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Well, if you wish it so much, why, we\\'ll make it, your Treaty.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Well and good! When that\\'s done, I will come home. Till then, I\\nam bound by an oath.\\n\\nCINESIAS. At any rate, let\\'s have a short time together.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. No, no, no! ... all the same I cannot say I don\\'t love you.\\n\\nCINESIAS. You love me? Then why refuse what I ask, my little girl, my\\nsweet Myrrhiné.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. You must be joking! What, before the child!\\n\\nCINESIAS. Manes, carry the lad home. There, you see, the child is gone;\\nthere\\'s nothing to hinder us; let us to work!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. But, miserable man, where, where are we to do it?\\n\\nCINESIAS. In the cave of Pan; nothing could be better.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. But how to purify myself, before going back into the citadel?\\n\\nCINESIAS. Nothing easier! you can wash at the Clepsydra.[448]\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. But my oath? Do you want me to perjure myself?\\n\\nCINESIAS. I take all responsibility; never make yourself anxious.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Well, I\\'ll be off, then, and find a bed for us.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Oh! \\'tis not worth while; we can lie on the ground surely.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. No, no! bad man as you are, I don\\'t like your lying on the bare\\nearth.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Ah! how the dear girl loves me!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with a bed_). Come, get to bed quick; I am going\\nto undress. But, plague take it, we must get a mattress.\\n\\nCINESIAS. A mattress! Oh! no, never mind!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. No, by Artemis! lie on the bare sacking, never! That were too\\nsqualid.\\n\\nCINESIAS. A kiss!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Wait a minute!\\n\\nCINESIAS. Oh! by the great gods, be quick back!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with a mattress_). Here is a mattress. Lie down, I\\nam just going to undress. But, but you\\'ve got no pillow.\\n\\nCINESIAS. I don\\'t want one, no, no.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. But _I_ do.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Oh! dear, oh, dear! they treat my poor penis for all the world\\nlike Heracles.[449]\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with a pillow_). There, lift your head, dear!\\n\\nCINESIAS. That\\'s really everything.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Is it everything, I wonder.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Come, my treasure.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. I am just unfastening my girdle. But remember what you promised\\nme about making Peace; mind you keep your word.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Yes, yes, upon my life I will.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Why, you have no blanket.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Great Zeus! what matter of that? \\'tis you I want to fuck.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ Never fear--directly, directly! I\\'ll be back in no time.\\n\\nCINESIAS. The woman will kill me with her blankets!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with a blanket_). Now, get up for one moment.\\n\\nCINESIAS. But I tell you, our friend here is up--all stiff and ready!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Would you like me to scent you?\\n\\nCINESIAS. No, by Apollo, no, please!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Yes, by Aphrodité, but I will, whether you wish it or no.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Ah! great Zeus, may she soon be done!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with a flask of perfume_). Hold out your hand; now\\nrub it in.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Oh! in Apollo\\'s name, I don\\'t much like the smell of it; but\\nperhaps \\'twill improve when it\\'s well rubbed in. It does not somehow\\nsmack of the marriage bed!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. There, what a scatterbrain I am; if I have not brought Rhodian\\nperfumes![450]\\n\\nCINESIAS. Never mind, dearest, let be now.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. You are joking!\\n\\nCINESIAS. Deuce take the man who first invented perfumes, say I!\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with another flask_). Here, take this bottle.\\n\\nCINESIAS. I have a better all ready for your service, darling. Come, you\\nprovoking creature, to bed with you, and don\\'t bring another thing.\\n\\nMYRRHINÉ. Coming, coming; I\\'m just slipping off my shoes. Dear boy, will\\nyou vote for peace?\\n\\nCINESIAS. I\\'ll think about it. (_Myrrhiné runs away._) I\\'m a dead man,\\nshe is killing me! She has gone, and left me in torment! I must have\\nsomeone to fuck, I must! Ah me! the loveliest of women has choused and\\ncheated me. Poor little lad (_addressing his penis_), how am I to give\\nyou what you want so badly? Where is Cynalopex? quick, man, get him a\\nnurse, do![451]\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Poor, miserable wretch, baulked in your amorousness!\\nwhat tortures are yours! Ah! you fill me with pity. Could any man\\'s back\\nand loins stand such a strain? His organ stands stiff and rigid, and\\nthere\\'s never a wench to help him!\\n\\nCINESIAS. Ye gods in heaven, what pains I suffer!\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Well, there it is; \\'tis her doing, that abandoned\\nhussy!\\n\\nCINESIAS. Nay, nay! rather say that sweetest, dearest darling.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. That dearest darling? no, no, that hussy, say I! Zeus,\\nthou god of the skies, canst not let loose a hurricane, to sweep them all\\nup into the air, and whirl \\'em round, then drop \\'em down crash! and\\nimpale them on the point of his weapon!\\n\\nA HERALD. Say, where shall I find the Senate and the Prytanes? I am\\nbearer of despatches.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. But are you a man or a Priapus, pray?[452]\\n\\nHERALD. Oh! but he\\'s mighty simple. I am a herald, of course, I swear I\\nam, and I come from Sparta about making peace.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. But look, you are hiding a lance under your clothes, surely.\\n\\nHERALD. No, nothing of the sort.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Then why do you turn away like that, and hold your cloak out\\nfrom your body? Have you gotten swellings in the groin with your journey?\\n\\nHERALD. By the twin brethren! the man\\'s an old maniac.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Ah, ha! my fine lad, why I can see it standing, oh fie!\\n\\nHERALD. I tell you no! but enough of this foolery.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Well, what is it you have there then?\\n\\nHERALD. A Lacedaemonian \\'skytalé.\\'[453]\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Oh, indeed, a \\'skytalé,\\' is it? Well, well, speak out\\nfrankly; I know all about these matters. How are things going at Sparta\\nnow?\\n\\nHERALD. Why, everything is turned upside down at Sparta; and all the\\nallies are half dead with lusting. We simply must have Pellené.[454]\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. What is the reason of it all? Is it the god Pan\\'s doing?\\n\\nHERALD. No, but Lampito\\'s and the Spartan women\\'s, acting at her\\ninstigation; they have denied the men all access to their cunts.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. But whatever do you do?\\n\\nHERALD. We are at our wits\\' end; we walk bent double, just as if we were\\ncarrying lanterns in a wind. The jades have sworn we shall not so much as\\ntouch their cunts till we have all agreed to conclude peace.\\n\\nMAGISTRATE. Ha, ha! So I see now, \\'tis a general conspiracy embracing all\\nGreece. Go you back to Sparta and bid them send Envoys with plenary\\npowers to treat for peace. I will urge our Senators myself to name\\nPlenipotentiaries from us; and to persuade them, why, I will show them\\nthis. (_Pointing to his erect penis._)\\n\\nHERALD. What could be better? I fly at your command.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. No wild beast is there, no flame of fire, more fierce\\nand untameable than woman; the panther is less savage and shameless.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. And yet you dare to make war upon me, wretch, when you\\nmight have me for your most faithful friend and ally.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Never, never can my hatred cease towards women.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Well, please yourself. Still I cannot bear to leave you\\nall naked as you are; folks would laugh at me. Come, I am going to put\\nthis tunic on you.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. You are right, upon my word! it was only in my\\nconfounded fit of rage I took it off.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Now at any rate you look like a man, and they won\\'t make\\nfun of you. Ah! if you had not offended me so badly, I would take out\\nthat nasty insect you have in your eye for you.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah! so that\\'s what was annoying me so! Look, here\\'s a\\nring, just remove the insect, and show it me. By Zeus! it has been\\nhurting my eye this ever so long.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Well, I agree, though your manners are not over and\\nabove pleasant. Oh! what a huge great gnat! just look! It\\'s from\\nTricorysus, for sure.[455]\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. A thousand thanks! the creature was digging a regular\\nwell in my eye; now it\\'s gone, my tears flow freely.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I will wipe them for you--bad, naughty man though you\\nare. Now, just one kiss.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. No--a kiss, certainly not!\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Just one, whether you like it or not.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Oh! those confounded women! how they do cajole us! How\\ntrue the saying: \"\\'Tis impossible to live with the baggages, impossible\\nto live without \\'em\"! Come, let us agree for the future not to regard\\neach other any more as enemies; and to clinch the bargain, let us sing a\\nchoric song.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. We desire, Athenians, to speak ill of no man; but on the\\ncontrary to say much good of everyone, and to _do_ the like. We have had\\nenough of misfortunes and calamities. Is there any, man or woman, wants a\\nbit of money--two or three minas or so;[456] well, our purse is full. If\\nonly peace is concluded, the borrower will not have to pay back. Also I\\'m\\ninviting to supper a few Carystian friends,[457] who are excellently well\\nqualified. I have still a drop of good soup left, and a young porker I\\'m\\ngoing to kill, and the flesh will be sweet and tender. I shall expect you\\nat my house to-day; but first away to the baths with you, you and your\\nchildren; then come all of you, ask no one\\'s leave, but walk straight up,\\nas if you were at home; never fear, the door will be ... shut in your\\nfaces![458]\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah! here come the Envoys from Sparta with their long\\nflowing beards; why, you would think they wore a cage[459] between their\\nthighs. (_Enter the Lacedaemonian Envoys._) Hail to you, first of all,\\nLaconians; then tell us how you fare.\\n\\nA LACONIAN. No need for many words; you see what a state we are in.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Alas! the situation grows more and more strained! the\\nintensity of the thing is just frightful.\\n\\nLACONIAN. \\'Tis beyond belief. But to work! summon your Commissioners, and\\nlet us patch up the best peace we may.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah! our men too, like wrestlers in the arena, cannot\\nendure a rag over their bellies; \\'tis an athlete\\'s malady, which only\\nexercise can remedy.\\n\\nAN ATHENIAN. Can anybody tell us where Lysistrata is? Surely she will\\nhave some compassion on our condition.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Look! \\'tis the very same complaint. (_Addressing the\\nAthenian._) Don\\'t you feel of mornings a strong nervous tension?\\n\\nATHENIAN. Yes, and a dreadful, dreadful torture it is! Unless peace is\\nmade very soon, we shall find no resource but to fuck Clisthenes.[460]\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Take my advice, and put on your clothes again; one of\\nthe fellows who mutilated the Hermae[461] might see you.\\n\\nATHENIAN. You are right.\\n\\nLACONIAN. Quite right. There, I will slip on my tunic.\\n\\nATHENIAN. Oh! what a terrible state we are in! Greeting to you, Laconian\\nfellow-sufferers.\\n\\nLACONIAN (_addressing one of his countrymen_). Ah! my boy, what a thing\\nit would have been if these fellows had seen us just now when our tools\\nwere on full stand!\\n\\nATHENIAN. Speak out, Laconians, what is it brings you here?\\n\\nLACONIAN. We have come to treat for peace.\\n\\nATHENIAN. Well said; we are of the same mind. Better call Lysistrata\\nthen; she is the only person will bring us to terms.\\n\\nLACONIAN. Yes, yes--and Lysistratus into the bargain, if you will.\\n\\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Needless to call her; she has heard your voices, and\\nhere she comes.\\n\\nATHENIAN. Hail, boldest and bravest of womankind! The time is come to\\nshow yourself in turn uncompromising and conciliatory, exacting and\\nyielding, haughty and condescending. Call up all your skill and\\nartfulness. Lo! the foremost men in Hellas, seduced by your fascinations,\\nare agreed to entrust you with the task of ending their quarrels.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. \\'Twill be an easy task--if only they refrain from mutual\\nindulgence in masculine love; if they do, I shall know the fact at once.\\nNow, where is the gentle goddess Peace? Lead hither the Laconian Envoys.\\nBut, look you, no roughness or violence; our husbands always behaved so\\nboorishly.[462] Bring them to me with smiles, as women should. If any\\nrefuse to give you his hand, then catch him by the penis and draw him\\npolitely forward. Bring up the Athenians too; you may take them just how\\nyou will. Laconians, approach; and you, Athenians, on my other side. Now\\nhearken all! I am but a woman; but I have good common sense; Nature has\\ndowered me with discriminating judgment, which I have yet further\\ndeveloped, thanks to the wise teachings of my father and the elders of\\nthe city. First I must bring a reproach against you that applies equally\\nto both sides. At Olympia, and Thermopylae, and Delphi, and a score of\\nother places too numerous to mention, you celebrate before the same\\naltars ceremonies common to all Hellenes; yet you go cutting each other\\'s\\nthroats, and sacking Hellenic cities, when all the while the Barbarian is\\nyonder threatening you! That is my first point.\\n\\nATHENIAN. Ah, ah! concupiscence is killing me!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Now \\'tis to you I address myself, Laconians. Have you\\nforgotten how Periclides,[463] your own countryman, sat a suppliant\\nbefore our altars? How pale he was in his purple robes! He had come to\\ncrave an army of us; \\'twas the time when Messenia was pressing you sore,\\nand the Sea-god was shaking the earth. Cimon marched to your aid at the\\nhead of four thousand hoplites, and saved Lacedaemon. And, after such a\\nservice as that, you ravage the soil of your benefactors!\\n\\nATHENIAN. They do wrong, very wrong, Lysistrata.\\n\\nLACONIAN. We do wrong, very wrong. Ah! great gods! what lovely thighs she\\nhas!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. And now a word to the Athenians. Have you no memory left of\\nhow, in the days when ye wore the tunic of slaves, the Laconians came,\\nspear in hand, and slew a host of Thessalians and partisans of Hippias\\nthe Tyrant? They, and they only, fought on your side on that eventful\\nday; they delivered you from despotism, and thanks to them our Nation\\ncould change the short tunic of the slave for the long cloak of the free\\nman.\\n\\nLACONIAN. I have never seen a woman of more gracious dignity.\\n\\nATHENIAN. I have never seen a woman with a finer cunt!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Bound by such ties of mutual kindness, how can you bear to be\\nat war? Stop, stay the hateful strife, be reconciled; what hinders you?\\n\\nLACONIAN. We are quite ready, if they will give us back our rampart.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. What rampart, my dear man?\\n\\nLACONIAN. Pylos, which we have been asking for and craving for ever so\\nlong.\\n\\nATHENIAN. In the Sea-god\\'s name, you shall never have it!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Agree, my friends, agree.\\n\\nATHENIAN. But then what city shall we be able to stir up trouble in?\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Ask for another place in exchange.\\n\\nATHENIAN. Ah! that\\'s the ticket! Well, to begin with, give us Echinus,\\nthe Maliac gulf adjoining, and the two legs of Megara.[464]\\n\\nLACONIAN. Oh! surely, surely not all that, my dear sir.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Come to terms; never make a difficulty of two legs more or\\nless!\\n\\nATHENIAN. Well, I\\'m ready now to off coat and cultivate my land.\\n\\nLACONIAN. And I too, to dung it to start with.\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. That\\'s just what you shall do, once peace is signed. So, if\\nyou really want to make it, go consult your allies about the matter.\\n\\nATHENIAN. What allies, I should like to know? Why, we are _all_ on the\\nstand; not one but is mad to be fucking. What we all want, is to be abed\\nwith our wives; how should our allies fail to second our project?\\n\\nLACONIAN. And ours the same, for certain sure!\\n\\nATHENIANS. The Carystians first and foremost, by the gods!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. Well said, indeed! Now be off to purify yourselves for\\nentering the Acropolis, where the women invite you to supper; we will\\nempty our provision baskets to do you honour. At table, you will exchange\\noaths and pledges; then each man will go home with his wife.\\n\\nATHENIAN. Come along then, and as quick as may be.\\n\\nLACONIAN. Lead on; I\\'m your man.\\n\\nATHENIAN. Quick, quick\\'s the word, say I.\\n\\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Embroidered stuffs, and dainty tunics, and flowing\\ngowns, and golden ornaments, everything I have, I offer them you with all\\nmy heart; take them all for your children, for your girls, against they\\nare chosen \"basket-bearers\" to the goddess. I invite you every one to\\nenter, come in and choose whatever you will; there is nothing so well\\nfastened, you cannot break the seals, and carry away the contents. Look\\nabout you everywhere ... you won\\'t find a blessed thing, unless you have\\nsharper eyes than mine.[465] And if any of you lacks corn to feed his\\nslaves and his young and numerous family, why, I have a few grains of\\nwheat at home; let him take what I have to give, a big twelve-pound loaf\\nincluded. So let my poorer neighbours all come with bags and wallets; my\\nman, Manes, shall give them corn; but I warn them not to come near my\\ndoor, or--beware the dog![465]\\n\\nA MARKET-LOUNGER. I say, you, open the door!\\n\\nA SLAVE. Go your way, I tell you. Why, bless me, they\\'re sitting down\\nnow; I shall have to singe \\'em with my torch to make \\'em stir! What an\\nimpudent lot of fellows!\\n\\nMARKET-LOUNGER. I don\\'t mean to budge.\\n\\nSLAVE. Well, as you _must_ stop, and I don\\'t want to offend you--but\\nyou\\'ll see some queer sights.\\n\\nMARKET-LOUNGER. Well and good, I\\'ve no objection.\\n\\nSLAVE. No, no, you must be off--or I\\'ll tear your hair out, I will; be\\noff, I say, and don\\'t annoy the Laconian Envoys; they\\'re just coming out\\nfrom the banquet-hall.\\n\\nAN ATHENIAN. Such a merry banquet I\\'ve never seen before! The Laconians\\nwere simply charming. After the drink is in, why, we\\'re all wise men,\\nall. It\\'s only natural, to be sure, for sober, we\\'re all fools. Take my\\nadvice, my fellow-countrymen, our Envoys should always be drunk. We go to\\nSparta; we enter the city sober; why, we must be picking a quarrel\\ndirectly. We don\\'t understand what they say to us, we imagine a lot they\\ndon\\'t say at all, and we report home all wrong, all topsy-turvy. But,\\nlook you, to-day it\\'s quite different; we\\'re enchanted whatever happens;\\ninstead of Clitagoras, they might sing us Telamon,[466] and we should\\nclap our hands just the same. A perjury or two into the bargain, la! what\\ndoes that matter to merry companions in their cups?\\n\\nSLAVE. But here they are back again! Will you begone, you loafing\\nscoundrels.\\n\\nMARKET-LOUNGER. Ah ha! here\\'s the company coming out already.\\n\\nA LACONIAN. My dear, sweet friend, come, take your flute in hand; I would\\nfain dance and sing my best in honour of the Athenians and our noble\\nselves.\\n\\nAN ATHENIAN. Yes, take your flute, i\\' the gods\\' name. What a delight to\\nsee him dance!\\n\\nCHORUS OF LACONIANS. Oh Mnemosyné! inspire these men, inspire my muse who\\nknows our exploits and those of the Athenians. With what a godlike ardour\\ndid they swoop down at Artemisium[467] on the ships of the Medes! What a\\nglorious victory was that! For the soldiers of Leonidas,[468] they were\\nlike fierce wild-boars whetting their tushes. The sweat ran down their\\nfaces, and drenched all their limbs, for verily the Persians were as many\\nas the sands of the seashore. Oh! Artemis, huntress queen, whose arrows\\npierce the denizens of the woods, virgin goddess, be thou favourable to\\nthe Peace we here conclude; through thee may our hearts be long united!\\nMay this treaty draw close for ever the bonds of a happy friendship! No\\nmore wiles and stratagems! Aid us, oh! aid us, maiden huntress!\\n\\nLYSISTRATA. All is for the best; and now, Laconians, take your wives away\\nhome with you, and you, Athenians, yours. May husband live happily with\\nwife, and wife with husband. Dance, dance, to celebrate our bliss, and\\nlet us be heedful to avoid like mistakes for the future.\\n\\nCHORUS OF ATHENIANS Appear, appear, dancers, and the Graces with you! Let\\nus invoke, one and all, Artemis, and her heavenly brother, gracious\\nApollo, patron of the dance, and Dionysus, whose eye darts flame, as he\\nsteps forward surrounded by the Maenad maids, and Zeus, who wields the\\nflashing lightning, and his august, thrice-blessed spouse, the Queen of\\nHeaven! These let us invoke, and all the other gods, calling all the\\ninhabitants of the skies to witness the noble Peace now concluded under\\nthe fond auspices of Aphrodité. Io Paean! Io Paean! dance, leap, as in\\nhonour of a victory won. Evoé! Evoé! And you, our Laconian guests, sing\\nus a new and inspiring strain!\\n\\nCHORUS OF LACONIANS. Leave once more, oh! leave once more the noble\\nheight of Taygetus, oh! Muse of Lacedaemon, and join us in singing the\\npraises of Apollo of Amyclae, and Athena of the Brazen House, and the\\ngallant twin sons of Tyndarus, who practise arms on the banks of Eurotas\\nriver.[469] Haste, haste hither with nimble-footed pace, let us sing\\nSparta, the city that delights in choruses divinely sweet and graceful\\ndances, when our maidens bound lightly by the river side, like frolicsome\\nfillies, beating the ground with rapid steps and shaking their long locks\\nin the wind, as Bacchantes wave their wands in the wild revels of the\\nWine-god. At their head, oh! chaste and beauteous goddess, daughter of\\nLatona, Artemis, do thou lead the song and dance. A fillet binding thy\\nwaving tresses, appear in thy loveliness; leap like a fawn; strike thy\\ndivine hands together to animate the dance, and aid us to renown the\\nvaliant goddess of battles, great Athené of the Brazen House!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFINIS OF \"LYSISTRATA\"', 'house.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTHE CLOUDS\\n\\n\\nSTREPSIADES.[470] Great gods! will these nights never end? will daylight\\nnever come? I heard the cock crow long ago and my slaves are snoring\\nstill! Ah! \\'twas not so formerly. Curses on the War! has it not done me\\nills enough? Now I may not even chastise my own slaves.[471] Again\\nthere\\'s this brave lad, who never wakes the whole long night, but,\\nwrapped in his five coverlets, farts away to his heart\\'s content. Come!\\nlet me nestle in well and snore too, if it be possible ... oh! misery,\\n\\'tis vain to think of sleep with all these expenses, this stable, these\\ndebts, which are devouring me, thanks to this fine cavalier, who only\\nknows how to look after his long locks, to show himself off in his\\nchariot and to dream of horses! And I, I am nearly dead, when I see the\\nmoon bringing the third decade in her train[472] and my liability falling\\ndue.... Slave! light the lamp and bring me my tablets. Who are all my\\ncreditors? Let me see and reckon up the interest. What is it I owe? ...\\nTwelve minae to Pasias.... What! twelve minae to Pasias? ... Why did I\\nborrow these? Ah! I know! \\'Twas to buy that thoroughbred, which cost me\\nso dear.[473] How I should have prized the stone that had blinded him!\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES (_in his sleep_). That\\'s not fair, Philo! Drive your chariot\\nstraight,[474] I say.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. \\'Tis this that is destroying me. He raves about horses, even\\nin his sleep.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES (_still sleeping_). How many times round the track is the\\nrace for the chariots of war?[475]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. \\'Tis your own father you are driving to death ... to ruin.\\nCome! what debt comes next, after that of Pasias? ... Three minae to\\nAmynias for a chariot and its two wheels.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES (_still asleep_). Give the horse a good roll in the dust and\\nlead him home.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! wretched boy! \\'tis my money that you are making roll. My\\ncreditors have distrained on my goods, and here are others again, who\\ndemand security for their interest.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES (_awaking_). What is the matter with you, father, that you\\ngroan and turn about the whole night through?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I have a bum-bailiff in the bedclothes biting me.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. For pity\\'s sake, let me have a little sleep.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Very well, sleep on! but remember that all these debts will\\nfall back on your shoulders. Oh! curses on the go-between who made me\\nmarry your mother! I lived so happily in the country, a commonplace,\\neveryday life, but a good and easy one--had not a trouble, not a care,\\nwas rich in bees, in sheep and in olives. Then forsooth I must marry the\\nniece of Megacles, the son of Megacles; I belonged to the country, she\\nwas from the town; she was a haughty, extravagant woman, a true\\nCoesyra.[476] On the nuptial day, when I lay beside her, I was reeking of\\nthe dregs of the wine-cup, of cheese and of wool; she was redolent with\\nessences, saffron, tender kisses, the love of spending, of good cheer and\\nof wanton delights. I will not say she did nothing; no, she worked hard\\n... to ruin me, and pretending all the while merely to be showing her the\\ncloak she had woven for me, I said, \"Wife, you go too fast about your\\nwork, your threads are too closely woven and you use far too much wool.\"\\n\\nA SLAVE. There is no more oil in the lamp.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why then did you light such a guzzling lamp? Come here, I am\\ngoing to beat you!\\n\\nSLAVE. What for?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Because you have put in too thick a wick.... Later, when we\\nhad this boy, what was to be his name? \\'Twas the cause of much\\nquarrelling with my loving wife. She insisted on having some reference to\\na horse in his name, that he should be called Xanthippus, Charippus or\\nCallippides.[477] I wanted to name him Phidonides after his\\ngrandfather.[478] We disputed long, and finally agreed to style him\\nPhidippides....[479] She used to fondle and coax him, saying, \"Oh! what a\\njoy it will be to me when you have grown up, to see you, like my father,\\nMegacles,[480] clothed in purple and standing up straight in your chariot\\ndriving your steeds toward the town.\" And I would say to him, \"When, like\\nyour father, you will go, dressed in a skin, to fetch back your goats\\nfrom Phelleus.\"[481] Alas! he never listened to me and his madness for\\nhorses has shattered my fortune. But by dint of thinking the livelong\\nnight, I have discovered a road to salvation, both miraculous and divine.\\nIf he will but follow it, I shall be out of my trouble! First, however,\\nhe must be awakened, but let it be done as gently as possible. How shall\\nI manage it? Phidippides! my little Phidippides!\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. What is it, father!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Kiss me and give me your hand.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. There! What\\'s it all about?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Tell me! do you love me?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. By Posidon, the equestrian Posidon! yes, I swear I do.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, do not, I pray you, invoke this god of horses; \\'tis he\\nwho is the cause of all my cares. But if you really love me, and with\\nyour whole heart, my boy, believe me.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Believe you? about what?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Alter your habits forthwith and go and learn what I tell\\nyou.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Say on, what are your orders?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Will you obey me ever so little?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. By Bacchus, I will obey you.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Very well then! Look this way. Do you see that little door\\nand that little house?[482]\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Yes, father. But what are you driving at?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. That is the school of wisdom. There, they prove that we are\\ncoals enclosed on all sides under a vast extinguisher, which is the\\nsky.[483] If well paid,[484] these men also teach one how to gain\\nlaw-suits, whether they be just or not.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. What do they call themselves?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I do not know exactly, but they are deep thinkers and most\\nadmirable people.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Bah! the wretches! I know them; you mean those quacks with\\nlivid faces,[485] those barefoot fellows, such as that miserable Socrates\\nand Chaerephon.[486]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Silence! say nothing foolish! If you desire your father not\\nto die of hunger, join their company and let your horses go.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. No, by Bacchus! even though you gave me the pheasants that\\nLeogoras rears.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! my beloved son, I beseech you, go and follow their\\nteachings.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. And what is it I should learn?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. \\'Twould seem they have two courses of reasoning, the true\\nand the false, and that, thanks to the false, the worst law-suits can be\\ngained. If then you learn this science, which is false, I shall not pay\\nan obolus of all the debts I have contracted on your account.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. No, I will not do it. I should no longer dare to look at our\\ngallant horsemen, when I had so tarnished my fair hue of honour.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Well then, by Demeter! I will no longer support you, neither\\nyou, nor your team, nor your saddle-horse. Go and hang yourself, I turn\\nyou out of house and home.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. My uncle Megacles will not leave me without horses; I shall\\ngo to him and laugh at your anger.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. One rebuff shall not dishearten me. With the help of the\\ngods I will enter this school and learn myself. But at my age, memory has\\ngone and the mind is slow to grasp things. How can all these fine\\ndistinctions, these subtleties be learned? Bah! why should I dally thus\\ninstead of rapping at the door? Slave, slave! (_He knocks and calls._)\\n\\nA DISCIPLE. A plague on you! Who are you?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Strepsiades, the son of Phido, of the deme of Cicynna.\\n\\nDISCIPLE. \\'Tis for sure only an ignorant and illiterate fellow who lets\\ndrive at the door with such kicks. You have brought on a miscarriage--of\\nan idea!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Pardon me, pray; for I live far away from here in the\\ncountry. But tell me, what was the idea that miscarried?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. I may not tell it to any but a disciple.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Then tell me without fear, for I have come to study among\\nyou.\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Very well then, but reflect, that these are mysteries. Lately,\\na flea bit Chaerephon on the brow and then from there sprang on to the\\nhead of Socrates. Socrates asked Chaerephon, \"How many times the length\\nof its legs does a flea jump?\"\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And how ever did he set about measuring it?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Oh! \\'twas most ingenious! He melted some wax, seized the flea\\nand dipped its two feet in the wax, which, when cooled, left them shod\\nwith true Persian buskins.[487] These he slipped off and with them\\nmeasured the distance.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! great Zeus! what a brain! what subtlety!\\n\\nDISCIPLE. I wonder what then would you say, if you knew another of\\nSocrates\\' contrivances?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What is it? Pray tell me.\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Chaerephon of the deme of Sphettia asked him whether he thought\\na gnat buzzed through its proboscis or through its rear.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And what did he say about the gnat?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. He said that the gut of the gnat was narrow, and that, in\\npassing through this tiny passage, the air is driven with force towards\\nthe breech; then after this slender channel, it encountered the rump,\\nwhich was distended like a trumpet, and there it resounded sonorously.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. So the rear of a gnat is a trumpet. Oh! what a splendid\\ndiscovery! Thrice happy Socrates! \\'Twould not be difficult to succeed in\\na law-suit, knowing so much about the gut of a gnat!\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Not long ago a lizard caused him the loss of a sublime thought.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. In what way, an it please you?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. One night, when he was studying the course of the moon and its\\nrevolutions and was gazing open-mouthed at the heavens, a lizard shitted\\nupon him from the top of the roof.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. This lizard, that relieved itself over Socrates, tickles me.\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Yesternight we had nothing to eat.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Well! What did he contrive, to secure you some supper?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. He spread over the table a light layer of cinders, bending an\\niron rod the while; then he took up a pair of compasses and at the same\\nmoment unhooked a piece of the victim which was hanging in the\\npalaestra.[488]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And we still dare to admire Thales![489] Open, open this\\nhome of knowledge to me quickly! Haste, haste to show me Socrates; I long\\nto become his disciple. But do, do open the door. (_The disciple admits\\nStrepsiades._) Ah! by Heracles! what country are those animals from?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Why, what are you astonished at? What do you think they\\nresemble?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. The captives of Pylos.[490] But why do they look so fixedly\\non the ground?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. They are seeking for what is below the ground.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! \\'tis onions they are seeking. Do not give yourselves so\\nmuch trouble; I know where there are some, fine and large ones. But what\\nare those fellows doing, who are bent all double?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. They are sounding the abysses of Tartarus.[491]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And what is their rump looking at in the heavens?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. It is studying astronomy on its own account. But come in; so\\nthat the master may not find us here.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Not yet, not yet; let them not change their position. I want\\nto tell them my own little matter.\\n\\nDISCIPLE. But they may not stay too long in the open air and away from\\nschool.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. In the name of all the gods, what is that? Tell me.\\n(_Pointing to a celestial globe._)\\n\\nDISCIPLE. That is astronomy.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And that? (_Pointing to a map._)\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Geometry.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What is that used for?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. To measure the land.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But that is apportioned by lot.[492]\\n\\nDISCIPLE. No, no, I mean the entire earth.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! what a funny thing! How generally useful indeed is this\\ninvention!\\n\\nDISCIPLE. There is the whole surface of the earth. Look! Here is Athens.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Athens! you are mistaken; I see no courts sitting.[493]\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Nevertheless it is really and truly the Attic territory.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And where are my neighbours of Cicynna?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. They live here. This is Euboea; you see this island, that is so\\nlong and narrow.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I know. \\'Tis we and Pericles, who have stretched it by dint\\nof squeezing it.[494] And where is Lacedaemon?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Lacedaemon? Why, here it is, look.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. How near it is to us! Think it well over, it must be removed\\nto a greater distance.\\n\\nDISCIPLE. But, by Zeus, that is not possible.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Then, woe to you! And who is this man suspended up in a\\nbasket?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. \\'Tis _he himself_.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Who himself?\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Socrates.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Socrates! Oh! I pray you, call him right loudly for me.\\n\\nDISCIPLE. Call him yourself; I have no time to waste.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Socrates! my little Socrates!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Mortal, what do you want with me?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. First, what are you doing up there? Tell me, I beseech you.\\n\\nSOCRATES. I traverse the air and contemplate the sun.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Thus \\'tis not on the solid ground, but from the height of\\nthis basket, that you slight the gods, if indeed....[495]\\n\\nSOCRATES. I have to suspend my brain and mingle the subtle essence of my\\nmind with this air, which is of the like nature, in order to clearly\\npenetrate the things of heaven.[496] I should have discovered nothing,\\nhad I remained on the ground to consider from below the things that are\\nabove; for the earth by its force attracts the sap of the mind to itself.\\n\\'Tis just the same with the water-cress.[497]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What? Does the mind attract the sap of the water-cress? Ah!\\nmy dear little Socrates, come down to me! I have come to ask you for\\nlessons.\\n\\nSOCRATES. And for what lessons?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I want to learn how to speak. I have borrowed money, and my\\nmerciless creditors do not leave me a moment\\'s peace; all my goods are at\\nstake.\\n\\nSOCRATES. And how was it you did not see that you were getting so much\\ninto debt?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. My ruin has been the madness for horses, a most rapacious\\nevil; but teach me one of your two methods of reasoning, the one whose\\nobject is not to repay anything, and, may the gods bear witness, that I\\nam ready to pay any fee you may name.\\n\\nSOCRATES. By which gods will you swear? To begin with, the gods are not a\\ncoin current with us.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But what do you swear by then? By the iron money of\\nByzantium?[498]\\n\\nSOCRATES. Do you really wish to know the truth of celestial matters?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why, truly, if \\'tis possible.\\n\\nSOCRATES. ... and to converse with the clouds, who are our genii?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Without a doubt.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Then be seated on this sacred couch.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I am seated.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Now take this chaplet.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why a chaplet? Alas! Socrates, would you sacrifice me, like\\nAthamas?[499]\\n\\nSOCRATES. No, these are the rites of initiation.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And what is it I am to gain?\\n\\nSOCRATES. You will become a thorough rattle-pate, a hardened old stager,\\nthe fine flour of the talkers.... But come, keep quiet.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. By Zeus! You lie not! Soon I shall be nothing but\\nwheat-flour, if you powder me in this fashion.[500]\\n\\nSOCRATES. Silence, old man, give heed to the prayers.... Oh! most mighty\\nking, the boundless air, that keepest the earth suspended in space, thou\\nbright Aether and ye venerable goddesses, the Clouds, who carry in your\\nloins the thunder and the lightning, arise, ye sovereign powers and\\nmanifest yourselves in the celestial spheres to the eyes of the sage.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Not yet! Wait a bit, till I fold my mantle double, so as not\\nto get wet. And to think that I did not even bring my travelling cap!\\nWhat a misfortune!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Come, oh! Clouds, whom I adore, come and show yourselves to\\nthis man, whether you be resting on the sacred summits of Olympus,\\ncrowned with hoar-frost, or tarrying in the gardens of Ocean, your\\nfather, forming sacred choruses with the Nymphs; whether you be gathering\\nthe waves of the Nile in golden vases or dwelling in the Maeotic marsh or\\non the snowy rocks of Mimas, hearken to my prayer and accept my offering.\\nMay these sacrifices be pleasing to you.\\n\\nCHORUS. Eternal Clouds, let us appear, let us arise from the roaring\\ndepths of Ocean, our father; let us fly towards the lofty mountains,\\nspread our damp wings over their forest-laden summits, whence we will\\ndominate the distant valleys, the harvest fed by the sacred earth, the\\nmurmur of the divine streams and the resounding waves of the sea, which\\nthe unwearying orb lights up with its glittering beams. But let us shake\\noff the rainy fogs, which hide our immortal beauty and sweep the earth\\nfrom afar with our gaze.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Oh, venerated goddesses, yes, you are answering my call! (_To\\nStrepsiades._) Did you hear their voices mingling with the awful growling\\nof the thunder?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! adorable Clouds, I revere you and I too am going to let\\noff _my_ thunder, so greatly has your own affrighted me. Faith! whether\\npermitted or not, I must, I must shit!\\n\\nSOCRATES. No scoffing; do not copy those accursed comic poets. Come,\\nsilence! a numerous host of goddesses approaches with songs.\\n\\nCHORUS. Virgins, who pour forth the rains, let us move toward Attica, the\\nrich country of Pallas, the home of the brave; let us visit the dear land\\nof Cecrops, where the secret rites[501] are celebrated, where the\\nmysterious sanctuary flies open to the initiate.... What victims are\\noffered there to the deities of heaven! What glorious temples! What\\nstatues! What holy prayers to the rulers of Olympus! At every season\\nnothing but sacred festivals, garlanded victims, are to be seen. Then\\nSpring brings round again the joyous feasts of Dionysus, the harmonious\\ncontests of the choruses and the serious melodies of the flute.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. By Zeus! Tell me, Socrates, I pray you, who are these women,\\nwhose language is so solemn; can they be demigoddesses?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Not at all. They are the Clouds of heaven, great goddesses for\\nthe lazy; to them we owe all, thoughts, speeches, trickery, roguery,\\nboasting, lies, sagacity.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! that was why, as I listened to them, my mind spread out\\nits wings; it burns to babble about trifles, to maintain worthless\\narguments, to voice its petty reasons, to contradict, to tease some\\nopponent. But are they not going to show themselves? I should like to see\\nthem, were it possible.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Well, look this way in the direction of Parnes;[502] I already\\nsee those who are slowly descending.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But where, where? Show them to me.\\n\\nSOCRATES. They are advancing in a throng, following an oblique path\\nacross the dales and thickets.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. \\'Tis strange! I can see nothing.\\n\\nSOCRATES. There, close to the entrance.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Hardly, if at all, can I distinguish them.\\n\\nSOCRATES. You _must_ see them clearly now, unless your eyes are filled\\nwith gum as thick as pumpkins.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Aye, undoubtedly! Oh! the venerable goddesses! Why, they\\nfill up the entire stage.\\n\\nSOCRATES. And you did not know, you never suspected, that they were\\ngoddesses?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. No, indeed; methought the Clouds were only fog, dew and\\nvapour.\\n\\nSOCRATES. But what you certainly do not know is that they are the support\\nof a crowd of quacks, both the diviners, who were sent to Thurium,[503]\\nthe notorious physicians, the well-combed fops, who load their fingers\\nwith rings down to the nails, and the baggarts, who write dithyrambic\\nverses, all these are idlers whom the Clouds provide a living for,\\nbecause they sing them in their verses.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. \\'Tis then for this that they praise \"the rapid flight of the\\nmoist clouds, which veil the brightness of day\" and \"the waving locks of\\nthe hundred-headed Typho\" and \"the impetuous tempests, which float\\nthrough the heavens, like birds of prey with aerial wings, loaded with\\nmists\" and \"the rains, the dew, which the clouds outpour.\"[504] As a\\nreward for these fine phrases they bolt well-grown, tasty mullet and\\ndelicate thrushes.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Yes, thanks to these. And is it not right and meet?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Tell me then why, if these really are the Clouds, they so\\nvery much resemble mortals. This is not their usual form.\\n\\nSOCRATES. What are they like then?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I don\\'t know exactly; well, they are like great packs of\\nwool, but not like women--no, not in the least.... And these have noses.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Answer my questions.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Willingly! Go on, I am listening.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Have you not sometimes seen clouds in the sky like a centaur, a\\nleopard, a wolf or a bull?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why, certainly I have, but what then?\\n\\nSOCRATES. They take what metamorphosis they like. If they see a debauchee\\nwith long flowing locks and hairy as a beast, like the son of\\nXenophantes,[505] they take the form of a Centaur[506] in derision of his\\nshameful passion.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And when they see Simon, that thiever of public money, what\\ndo they do then?\\n\\nSOCRATES. To picture him to the life, they turn at once into wolves.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. So that was why yesterday, when they saw Cleonymus,[507] who\\ncast away his buckler because he is the veriest poltroon amongst men,\\nthey changed into deer.\\n\\nSOCRATES. And to-day they have seen Clisthenes;[508] you see ... they are\\nwomen.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Hail, sovereign goddesses, and if ever you have let your\\ncelestial voice be heard by mortal ears, speak to me, oh! speak to me, ye\\nall-powerful queens.\\n\\nCHORUS. Hail! veteran of the ancient times, you who burn to instruct\\nyourself in fine language. And you, great high-priest of subtle nonsense,\\ntell us your desire. To you and Prodicus[509] alone of all the hollow\\norationers of to-day have we lent an ear--to Prodicus, because of his\\nknowledge and his great wisdom, and to you, because you walk with head\\nerect, a confident look, barefooted, resigned to everything and proud of\\nour protection.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! Earth! What august utterances! how sacred! how wondrous!\\n\\nSOCRATES. That is because these are the only goddesses; all the rest are\\npure myth.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But by the Earth! is our Father, Zeus, the Olympian, not a\\ngod?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Zeus! what Zeus? Are you mad? There is no Zeus.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What are you saying now? Who causes the rain to fall? Answer\\nme that!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Why, \\'tis these, and I will prove it. Have you ever seen it\\nraining without clouds? Let Zeus then cause rain with a clear sky and\\nwithout their presence!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. By Apollo! that is powerfully argued! For my own part, I\\nalways thought it was Zeus pissing into a sieve. But tell me, who is it\\nmakes the thunder, which I so much dread?\\n\\nSOCRATES. \\'Tis these, when they roll one over the other.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But how can that be? you most daring among men!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Being full of water, and forced to move along, they are of\\nnecessity precipitated in rain, being fully distended with moisture from\\nthe regions where they have been floating; hence they bump each other\\nheavily and burst with great noise.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But is it not Zeus who forces them to move?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Not at all; \\'tis aerial Whirlwind.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. The Whirlwind! ah! I did not know that. So Zeus, it seems,\\nhas no existence, and \\'tis the Whirlwind that reigns in his stead? But\\nyou have not yet told me what makes the roll of the thunder?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Have you not understood me then? I tell you, that the Clouds,\\nwhen full of rain, bump against one another, and that, being inordinately\\nswollen out, they burst with a great noise.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. How can you make me credit that?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Take yourself as an example. When you have heartily gorged on\\nstew at the Panathenaea, you get throes of stomach-ache and then suddenly\\nyour belly resounds with prolonged growling.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Yes, yes, by Apollo! I suffer, I get colic, then the stew\\nsets a-growling like thunder and finally bursts forth with a terrific\\nnoise. At first, \\'tis but a little gurgling _pappax, pappax_! then it\\nincreases, _papapappax!_ and when I seek relief, why, \\'tis thunder\\nindeed, _papapappax! pappax!! papapappax!!!_ just like the clouds.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Well then, reflect what a noise is produced by your belly,\\nwhich is but small. Shall not the air, which is boundless, produce these\\nmighty claps of thunder?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But tell me this. Whence comes the lightning, the dazzling\\nflame, which at times consumes the man it strikes, at others hardly\\nsinges him. Is it not plain, that \\'tis Zeus hurling it at the perjurers?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Out upon the fool! the driveller! he still savours of the\\ngolden age! If Zeus strikes at the perjurers, why has he not blasted\\nSimon, Cleonymus and Theorus?[510] Of a surety, greater perjurers cannot\\nexist. No, he strikes his own Temple, and Sunium, the promontory of\\nAthens,[511] and the towering oaks. Now, why should he do that? An oak is\\nno perjurer.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I cannot tell, but it seems to me well argued. What is the\\nthunder then?\\n\\nSOCRATES. When a dry wind ascends to the Clouds and gets shut into them,\\nit blows them out like a bladder; finally, being too confined, it bursts\\nthem, escapes with fierce violence and a roar to flash into flame by\\nreason of its own impetuosity.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Forsooth, \\'tis just what happened to me one day. \\'Twas at\\nthe feast of Zeus! I was cooking a sow\\'s belly for my family and I had\\nforgotten to slit it open. It swelled out and, suddenly bursting,\\ndischarged itself right into my eyes and burnt my face.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh, mortal! you, who desire to instruct yourself in our great\\nwisdom, the Athenians, the Greeks will envy you your good fortune. Only\\nyou must have the memory and ardour for study, you must know how to stand\\nthe tests, hold your own, go forward without feeling fatigue, caring but\\nlittle for food, abstaining from wine, gymnastic exercises and other\\nsimilar follies, in fact, you must believe as every man of intellect\\nshould, that the greatest of all blessings is to live and think more\\nclearly than the vulgar herd, to shine in the contests of words.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. If it be a question of hardiness for labour, of spending\\nwhole nights at work, of living sparingly, of fighting my stomach and\\nonly eating chick-pease, rest assured, I am as hard as an anvil.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Henceforward, following our example, you will recognize no\\nother gods but Chaos, the Clouds and the Tongue, these three alone.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I would not speak to the others, even if I should meet them\\nin the street; not a single sacrifice, not a libation, not a grain of\\nincense for them!\\n\\nCHORUS. Tell us boldly then what you want of us; you cannot fail to\\nsucceed, if you honour and revere us and if you are resolved to become a\\nclever man.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, sovereign goddesses, \\'tis but a very small favour that I\\nask of you; grant that I may distance all the Greeks by a hundred stadia\\nin the art of speaking.\\n\\nCHORUS. We grant you this, and henceforward no eloquence shall more often\\nsucceed with the people than your own.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. May the god shield me from possessing great eloquence! \\'Tis\\nnot what I want. I want to be able to turn bad lawsuits to my own\\nadvantage and to slip through the fingers of my creditors.\\n\\nCHORUS. It shall be as you wish, for your ambitions are modest. Commit\\nyourself fearlessly to our ministers, the sophists.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. This will I do, for I trust in you. Moreover there is no\\ndrawing back, what with these cursed horses and this marriage, which has\\neaten up my vitals. So let them do with me as they will; I yield my body\\nto them. Come blows, come hunger, thirst, heat or cold, little matters it\\nto me; they may flay me, if I only escape my debts, if only I win the\\nreputation of being a bold rascal, a fine speaker, impudent, shameless, a\\nbraggart, and adept at stringing lies, an old stager at quibbles, a\\ncomplete table of the laws, a thorough rattle, a fox to slip through any\\nhole; supple as a leathern strap, slippery as an eel, an artful fellow, a\\nblusterer, a villain; a knave with a hundred faces, cunning, intolerable,\\na gluttonous dog. With such epithets do I seek to be greeted; on these\\nterms, they can treat me as they choose, and, if they wish, by Demeter!\\nthey can turn me into sausages and serve me up to the philosophers.\\n\\nCHORUS. Here have we a bold and well-disposed pupil indeed. When we shall\\nhave taught you, your glory among the mortals will reach even to the\\nskies.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Wherein will that profit me?\\n\\nCHORUS. You will pass your whole life among us and will be the most\\nenvied of men.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Shall I really ever see such happiness?\\n\\nCHORUS. Clients will be everlastingly besieging your door in crowds,\\nburning to get at you, to explain their business to you and to consult\\nyou about their suits, which, in return for your ability, will bring you\\nin great sums. But, Socrates, begin the lessons you want to teach this\\nold man; rouse his mind, try the strength of his intelligence.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Come, tell me the kind of mind you have; \\'tis important I know\\nthis, that I may order my batteries against you in a new fashion.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Eh, what! in the name of the gods, are you purposing to\\nassault me then?\\n\\nSOCRATES. No. I only wish to ask you some questions. Have you any memory?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. That depends: if anything is owed me, my memory is\\nexcellent, but if I owe, alas! I have none whatever.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Have you a natural gift for speaking?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. For speaking, no; for cheating, yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES. How will you be able to learn then?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Very easily, have no fear.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Thus, when I throw forth some philosophical thought anent\\nthings celestial, you will seize it in its very flight?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Then I am to snap up wisdom much as a dog snaps up a morsel?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Oh! the ignoramus! the barbarian! I greatly fear, old man,\\n\\'twill be needful for me to have recourse to blows. Now, let me hear what\\nyou do when you are beaten.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I receive the blow, then wait a moment, take my witnesses\\nand finally summon my assailant at law.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Come, take off your cloak.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Have I robbed you of anything?\\n\\nSOCRATES. No, but \\'tis usual to enter the school without your cloak.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But I am not come here to look for stolen goods.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Off with it, fool!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Tell me, if I prove thoroughly attentive and learn with\\nzeal, which of your disciples shall I resemble, do you think?\\n\\nSOCRATES. You will be the image of Chaerephon.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! unhappy me! I shall then be but half alive?\\n\\nSOCRATES. A truce to this chatter! follow me and no more of it.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. First give me a honey-cake, for to descend down there sets\\nme all a-tremble; meseems \\'tis the cave of Trophonius.\\n\\nSOCRATES. But get in with you! What reason have you for thus dallying at\\nthe door?\\n\\nCHORUS. Good luck! you have courage; may you succeed, you, who, though\\nalready so advanced in years, wish to instruct your mind with new studies\\nand practise it in wisdom!\\n\\nCHORUS (_Parabasis_). Spectators! By Bacchus, whose servant I am, I will\\nfrankly tell you the truth. May I secure both victory and renown as\\ncertainly as I hold you for adept critics and as I regard this comedy as\\nmy best. I wished to give you the first view of a work, which had cost me\\nmuch trouble, but I withdrew, unjustly beaten by unskilful rivals.[512]\\n\\'Tis you, oh, enlightened public, for whom I have prepared my piece, that\\nI reproach with this. Nevertheless I shall never willingly cease to seek\\nthe approval of the discerning. I have not forgotten the day, when men,\\nwhom one is happy to have for an audience, received my \\'Young Man\\' and my\\n\\'Debauchee\\'[513] with so much favour in this very place. Then as yet\\nvirgin, my Muse had not attained the legal age for maternity;[514] she\\nhad to expose her first-born for another to adopt, and it has since grown\\nup under your generous patronage. Ever since you have as good as sworn me\\nyour faithful alliance. Thus, like Electra[515] of the poets, my comedy\\nhas come to seek you to-day, hoping again to encounter such enlightened\\nspectators. As far away as she can discern her Orestes, she will be able\\nto recognize him by his curly head. And note her modest demeanour! She\\nhas not sewn on a piece of hanging leather, thick and reddened at the\\nend,[516] to cause laughter among the children; she does not rail at the\\nbald, neither does she dance the cordax;[517] no old man is seen, who,\\nwhile uttering his lines, batters his questioner with a stick to make his\\npoor jests pass muster.[518] She does not rush upon the scene carrying a\\ntorch and screaming, \\'La, la! la, la!\\' No, she relies upon herself and\\nher verses.... My value is so well known, that I take no further pride in\\nit. I do not seek to deceive you, by reproducing the same subjects two or\\nthree times; I always invent fresh themes to present before you, themes\\nthat have no relation to each other and that are all clever. I attacked\\nCleon[519] to his face and when he was all-powerful; but he has fallen,\\nand now I have no desire to kick him when he is down. My rivals, on the\\ncontrary, once that this wretched Hyperbolus has given them the cue, have\\nnever ceased setting upon both him and his mother. First Eupolis\\npresented his \\'Maricas\\';[520] this was simply my \\'Knights,\\' whom this\\nplagiarist had clumsily furbished up again by adding to the piece an old\\ndrunken woman, so that she might dance the cordax. \\'Twas an old idea,\\ntaken from Phrynichus, who caused his old hag to be devoured by a monster\\nof the deep.[521] Then Hermippus[522] fell foul of Hyperbolus and now all\\nthe others fall upon him and repeat my comparison of the eels. May those\\nwho find amusement in their pieces not be pleased with mine, but as for\\nyou, who love and applaud my inventions, why, posterity will praise your\\ngood taste.\\n\\nOh, ruler of Olympus, all-powerful king of the gods, great Zeus, it is\\nthou whom I first invoke; protect this chorus; and thou too, Posidon,\\nwhose dread trident upheaves at the will of thy anger both the bowels of\\nthe earth and the salty waves of the ocean. I invoke my illustrious\\nfather, the divine Aether, the universal sustainer of life, and Phoebus,\\nwho, from the summit of his chariot, sets the world aflame with his\\ndazzling rays, Phoebus, a mighty deity amongst the gods and adored\\namongst mortals.\\n\\nMost wise spectators, lend us all your attention. Give heed to our just\\nreproaches. There exist no gods to whom this city owes more than it does\\nto us, whom alone you forget. Not a sacrifice, not a libation is there\\nfor those who protect you! Have you decreed some mad expedition? Well! we\\nthunder or we fall down in rain. When you chose that enemy of heaven, the\\nPaphlagonian tanner,[523] for a general, we knitted our brow, we caused\\nour wrath to break out; the lightning shot forth, the thunder pealed, the\\nmoon deserted her course and the sun at once veiled his beam threatening\\nno longer to give you light, if Cleon became general. Nevertheless you\\nelected him; \\'tis said, Athens never resolves upon some fatal step but\\nthe gods turn these errors into her greatest gain. Do you wish that this\\nelection should even now be a success for you? \\'Tis a very simple thing\\nto do; condemn this rapacious gull named Cleon[524] for bribery and\\nextortion, fit a wooden collar tight round his neck, and your error will\\nbe rectified and the commonweal will at once regain its old prosperity.\\n\\nAid me also, Phoebus, god of Delos, who reignest on the cragged peaks of\\nCynthia;[525] and thou, happy virgin,[526] to whom the Lydian damsels\\noffer pompous sacrifice in a temple of gold; and thou, goddess of our\\ncountry, Athené, armed with the aegis, the protectress of Athens; and\\nthou, who, surrounded by the Bacchanals of Delphi, roamest over the rocks\\nof Parnassus shaking the flame of thy resinous torch, thou, Bacchus, the\\ngod of revel and joy.\\n\\nAs we were preparing to come here, we were hailed by the Moon and were\\ncharged to wish joy and happiness both to the Athenians and to their\\nallies; further, she said that she was enraged and that you treated her\\nvery shamefully, her, who does not pay you in words alone, but who\\nrenders you all real benefits. Firstly, thanks to her, you save at least\\na drachma each month for lights, for each, as he is leaving home at\\nnight, says, \"Slave, buy no torches, for the moonlight is\\nbeautiful,\"--not to name a thousand other benefits. Nevertheless you do\\nnot reckon the days correctly and your calendar is naught but\\nconfusion.[527] Consequently the gods load her with threats each time\\nthey get home and are disappointed of their meal, because the festival\\nhas not been kept in the regular order of time. When you should be\\nsacrificing, you are putting to the torture or administering justice. And\\noften, we others, the gods, are fasting in token of mourning for the\\ndeath of Memnon or Sarpedon,[528] while you are devoting yourselves to\\njoyous libations. \\'Tis for this, that last year, when the lot would have\\ninvested Hyperbolus[529] with the duty of Amphictyon, we took his crown\\nfrom him, to teach him that time must be divided according to the phases\\nof the moon.\\n\\nSOCRATES. By Respiration, the Breath of Life! By Chaos! By the Air! I\\nhave never seen a man so gross, so inept, so stupid, so forgetful. All\\nthe little quibbles, which I teach him, he forgets even before he has\\nlearnt them. Yet I will not give it up, I will make him come out here\\ninto the open air. Where are you, Strepsiades? Come, bring your couch out\\nhere.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But the bugs will not allow me to bring it.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Have done with such nonsense! place it there and pay attention.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Well, here I am.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Good! Which science of all those you have never been taught, do\\nyou wish to learn first? The measures, the rhythms or the verses?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why, the measures; the flour dealer cheated me out of two\\n_choenixes_ the other day.\\n\\nSOCRATES. \\'Tis not about that I ask you, but which, according to you, is\\nthe best measure, the trimeter or the tetrameter?[530]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. The one I prefer is the semisextarius.\\n\\nSOCRATES. You talk nonsense, my good fellow.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I will wager your tetrameter is the semisextarius.[531]\\n\\nSOCRATES. Plague seize the dunce and the fool! Come, perchance you will\\nlearn the rhythms quicker.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Will the rhythms supply me with food?\\n\\nSOCRATES. First they will help you to be pleasant in company, then to\\nknow what is meant by oenoplian rhythm[532] and what by the\\ndactylic.[533]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Of the dactyl? I know that quite well.\\n\\nSOCRATES. What is it then?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why, \\'tis this finger; formerly, when a child, I used this\\none.[534]\\n\\nSOCRATES. You are as low-minded as you are stupid.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But, wretched man, I do not want to learn all this.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Then what _do_ you want to know?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Not that, not that, but the art of false reasoning.\\n\\nSOCRATES. But you must first learn other things. Come, what are the male\\nquadrupeds?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! I know the males thoroughly. Do you take me for a fool\\nthen? The ram, the buck, the bull, the dog, the pigeon.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Do you see what you are doing; is not the female pigeon called\\nthe same as the male?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. How else? Come now?\\n\\nSOCRATES. How else? With you then \\'tis pigeon and pigeon!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. \\'Tis true, by Posidon! but what names do you want me to give\\nthem?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Term the female pigeonnette and the male pigeon.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Pigeonnette! hah! by the Air! That\\'s splendid! for that\\nlesson bring out your kneading-trough and I will fill him with flour to\\nthe brim.\\n\\nSOCRATES. There you are wrong again; you make _trough_ masculine and it\\nshould be feminine.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What? if I say _him_, do I make the _trough_ masculine?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Assuredly! would you not say him for Cleonymus?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Well?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Then trough is of the same gender as Cleonymus?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! good sir! Cleonymus never had a kneading-trough;[535] he\\nused a round mortar for the purpose. But come, tell me what I _should_\\nsay?\\n\\nSOCRATES. For trough you should say _her_ as you would for Sostraté.[536]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. _Her_?\\n\\nSOCRATES. In this manner you make it truly female.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. That\\'s it! _Her_ for trough and _her_ for Cleonymus.[537]\\n\\nSOCRATES. Now I must teach you to distinguish the masculine proper names\\nfrom those that are feminine.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! I know the female names well.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Name some then.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Lysilla, Philinna, Clitagora, Demetria.\\n\\nSOCRATES. And what are masculine names?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. They are countless--Philoxenus, Melesias, Amynias.\\n\\nSOCRATES. But, wretched man, the last two are not masculine.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. You do not reckon them masculine?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Not at all. If you met Amynias, how would you hail him?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. How? Why, I should shout, \"Hi! hither, Amyni_a_!\"[538]\\n\\nSOCRATES. Do you see? \\'tis a female name that you give him.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And is it not rightly done, since he refuses military\\nservice? But what use is there in learning what we all know?\\n\\nSOCRATES. You know nothing about it. Come, lie down there.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What for?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Ponder awhile over matters that interest you.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! I pray you, not there! but, if I must lie down and\\nponder, let me lie on the ground.\\n\\nSOCRATES. \\'Tis out of the question. Come! on to the couch!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What cruel fate! What a torture the bugs will this day put\\nme to!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Ponder and examine closely, gather your thoughts together, let\\nyour mind turn to every side of things; if you meet with a difficulty,\\nspring quickly to some other idea; above all, keep your eyes away from\\nall gentle sleep.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, woe, woe! oh, woe, woe!\\n\\nSOCRATES. What ails you? why do you cry so?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! I am a dead man! Here are these cursed Corinthians[539]\\nadvancing upon me from all corners of the couch; they are biting me, they\\nare gnawing at my sides, they are drinking all my blood, they are\\ntwitching off my testicles, they are exploring all up my back, they are\\nkilling me!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Not so much wailing and clamour, if you please.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. How can I obey? I have lost my money and my complexion, my\\nblood and my slippers, and to cap my misery, I must keep awake on this\\ncouch, when scarce a breath of life is left in me.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Well now! what are you doing? are you reflecting?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Yes, by Posidon!\\n\\nSOCRATES. What about?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Whether the bugs will not entirely devour me.\\n\\nSOCRATES. May death seize you, accursed man!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! it has already.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Come, no giving way! Cover up your head; the thing to do is to\\nfind an ingenious alternative.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. An alternative! ah! I only wish one would come to me from\\nwithin these coverlets!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Hold! let us see what our fellow is doing. Ho! you! are you\\nasleep?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. No, by Apollo!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Have you got hold of anything?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. No, nothing whatever.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Nothing at all!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. No, nothing but my tool, which I\\'ve got in my hand.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Are you not going to cover your head immediately and ponder?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Over what? Come, Socrates, tell me.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Think first what you want, and then tell me.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But I have told you a thousand times what I want. \\'Tis not\\nto pay any of my creditors.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Come, wrap yourself up; concentrate your mind, which wanders\\ntoo lightly, study every detail, scheme and examine thoroughly.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, woe! woe! oh dear! oh dear!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Keep yourself quiet, and if any notion troubles you, put it\\nquickly aside, then resume it and think over it again.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. My dear little Socrates!\\n\\nSOCRATES. What is it, old greybeard?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I have a scheme for not paying my debts.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Let us hear it.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Tell me, if I purchased a Thessalian witch, I could make the\\nmoon descend during the night and shut it, like a mirror, into a round\\nbox and there keep it carefully....\\n\\nSOCRATES. How would you gain by that?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. How? Why, if the moon did not rise, I would have no interest\\nto pay.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Why so?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Because money is lent by the month.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Good! but I am going to propose another trick to you. If you\\nwere condemned to pay five talents, how would you manage to quash that\\nverdict? Tell me.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. How? how? I don\\'t know, I must think.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Do you always shut your thoughts within yourself. Let your\\nideas fly in the air, like a may-bug, tied by the foot with a thread.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I have found a very clever way to annul that conviction; you\\nwill admit that much yourself.\\n\\nSOCRATES. What is it?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Have you ever seen a beautiful, transparent stone at the\\ndruggists, with which you may kindle fire?\\n\\nSOCRATES. You mean a crystal lens.[540]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Well, what then?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. If I placed myself with this stone in the sun and a long way\\noff from the clerk, while he was writing out the conviction, I could make\\nall the wax, upon which the words were written, melt.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Well thought out, by the Graces!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! I am delighted to have annulled the decree that was to\\ncost me five talents.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Come, take up this next question quickly.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Which?\\n\\nSOCRATES. If, when summoned to court, you were in danger of losing your\\ncase for want of witnesses, how would you make the conviction fall upon\\nyour opponent?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. \\'Tis very simple and most easy.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Let me hear.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. This way. If another case had to be pleaded before mine was\\ncalled, I should run and hang myself.\\n\\nSOCRATES. You talk rubbish!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Not so, by the gods! if I was dead, no action could lie\\nagainst me.\\n\\nSOCRATES. You are merely beating the air. Begone! I will give you no more\\nlessons.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why not? Oh! Socrates! in the name of the gods!\\n\\nSOCRATES. But you forget as fast as you learn. Come, what was the thing I\\ntaught you first? Tell me.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! let me see. What was the first thing? What was it then?\\nAh! that thing in which we knead the bread, oh! my god! what do you call\\nit?\\n\\nSOCRATES. Plague take the most forgetful and silliest of old addlepates!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Alas! what a calamity! what will become of me? I am undone\\nif I do not learn how to ply my tongue. Oh! Clouds! give me good advice.\\n\\nCHORUS. Old man, we counsel you, if you have brought up a son, to send\\nhim to learn in your stead.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Undoubtedly I have a son, as well endowed as the best, but\\nhe is unwilling to learn. What will become of me?\\n\\nCHORUS. And you don\\'t make him obey you?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. You see, he is big and strong; moreover, through his mother\\nhe is a descendant of those fine birds, the race of Coesyra.[541]\\nNevertheless, I will go and find him, and if he refuses, I will turn him\\nout of the house. Go in, Socrates, and wait for me awhile.\\n\\nCHORUS (_to Socrates_). Do you understand, that, thanks to us, you will\\nbe loaded with benefits? Here is a man, ready to obey you in all things.\\nYou see how he is carried away with admiration and enthusiasm. Profit by\\nit to clip him as short as possible; fine chances are all too quickly\\ngone.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. No, by the Clouds! you stay no longer here; go and devour\\nthe ruins of your uncle Megacles\\' fortune.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Oh! my poor father! what has happened to you? By the\\nOlympian Zeus! you are no longer in your senses!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. See! see! \"the Olympian Zeus.\" Oh! the fool! to believe in\\nZeus at your age!\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. What is there in that to make you laugh?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. You are then a tiny little child, if you credit such\\nantiquated rubbish! But come here, that I may teach you; I will tell you\\nsomething very necessary to know to be a man; but you will not repeat it\\nto anybody.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Come, what is it?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Just now you swore by Zeus.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Aye, that I did.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Do you see how good it is to learn? Phidippides, there is no\\nZeus.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. What is there then?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. \\'Tis the Whirlwind, that has driven out Jupiter and is King\\nnow.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Go to! what drivel!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Know it to be the truth.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. And who says so?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. \\'Tis Socrates, the Melian,[542] and Chaerephon, who knows\\nhow to measure the jump of a flea.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Have you reached such a pitch of madness that you believe\\nthose bilious fellows?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Use better language, and do not insult men who are clever\\nand full of wisdom, who, to economize, are never shaved, shun the\\ngymnasia and never go to the baths, while you, you only await my death to\\neat up my wealth. But come, come as quickly as you can to learn in my\\nstead.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. And what good can be learnt of them?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What good indeed? Why, all human knowledge. Firstly, you\\nwill know yourself grossly ignorant. But await me here awhile.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Alas! what is to be done? My father has lost his wits. Must\\nI have him certificated for lunacy, or must I order his coffin?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Come! what kind of bird is this? tell me.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. A pigeon.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Good! And this female?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. A pigeon.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. The same for both? You make me laugh! For the future you\\nwill call this one a pigeonnette and the other a pigeon.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. A pigeonnette! These then are the fine things you have just\\nlearnt at the school of these sons of the Earth![543]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And many others; but what I learnt I forgot at once, because\\nI am too old.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. So this is why you have lost your cloak?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I have not lost it, I have consecrated it to Philosophy.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. And what have you done with your sandals, you poor fool?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. If I have lost them, it is for what was necessary, just as\\nPericles did.[544] But come, move yourself, let us go in; if necessary,\\ndo wrong to obey your father. When you were six years old and still\\nlisped, \\'twas I who obeyed you. I remember at the feasts of Zeus you had\\na consuming wish for a little chariot and I bought it for you with the\\nfirst obolus which I received as a juryman in the Courts.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. You will soon repent of what you ask me to do.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! now I am happy! He obeys. Here, Socrates, here! Come out\\nquick! Here I am bringing you my son; he refused, but I have persuaded\\nhim.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Why, he is but a child yet. He is not used to these baskets, in\\nwhich we suspend our minds.[545]\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. To make you better used to them, I would you were hung.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. A curse upon you! you insult your master!\\n\\nSOCRATES. \"I would you were hung!\" What a stupid speech! and so\\nemphatically spoken! How can one ever get out of an accusation with such\\na tone, summon witnesses or touch or convince? And yet when we think,\\nHyperbolus learnt all this for one talent!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Rest undisturbed and teach him. \\'Tis a most intelligent\\nnature. Even when quite little he amused himself at home with making\\nhouses, carving boats, constructing little chariots of leather, and\\nunderstood wonderfully how to make frogs out of pomegranate rinds. Teach\\nhim both methods of reasoning, the strong and also the weak, which by\\nfalse arguments triumphs over the strong; if not the two, at least the\\nfalse, and that in every possible way.\\n\\nSOCRATES. \\'Tis Just and Unjust Discourse themselves that shall instruct\\nhim.[546]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I go, but forget it not, he must always, always be able to\\nconfound the true.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Come here! Shameless as you may be, will you dare to show\\nyour face to the spectators?\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Take me where you list. I seek a throng, so that I may\\nthe better annihilate you.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Annihilate me! Do you forget who you are?\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. I am Reasoning.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Yes, the weaker Reasoning.[547]\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. But I triumph over you, who claim to be the stronger.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. By what cunning shifts, pray?\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. By the invention of new maxims.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. ... which are received with favour by these fools.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Say rather, by these wiseacres.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. I am going to destroy you mercilessly.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. How pray? Let us see you do it.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. By saying what is true.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. I shall retort and shall very soon have the better of\\nyou. First, I maintain that justice has no existence.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Has no existence?\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. No existence! Why, where are they?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. With the gods.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. How then, if justice exists, was Zeus not put to death\\nfor having put his father in chains?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Bah! this is enough to turn my stomach! A basin, quick!\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. You are an old driveller and stupid withal.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. And you a debauchee and a shameless fellow.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Hah! What sweet expressions!\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. An impious buffoon!\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. You crown me with roses and with lilies.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. A parricide.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Why, you shower gold upon me.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Formerly, \\'twas a hailstorm of blows.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. I deck myself with your abuse.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. What impudence!\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. What tomfoolery!\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. \\'Tis because of you that the youth no longer attends the\\nschools. The Athenians will soon recognize what lessons you teach those\\nwho are fools enough to believe you.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. You are overwhelmed with wretchedness.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. And you, you prosper. Yet you were poor when you said, \"I\\nam the Mysian Telephus,\"[548] and used to stuff your wallet with maxims\\nof Pandeletus[549] to nibble at.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Oh! the beautiful wisdom, of which you are now\\nboasting!\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Madman! But yet madder the city that keeps you, you, the\\ncorrupter of its youth!\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. \\'Tis not you who will teach this young man; you are as\\nold and out of date as Saturn.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Nay, it will certainly be I, if he does not wish to be\\nlost and to practise verbosity only.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE (_to Phidippides_). Come hither and leave him to beat\\nthe air.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE (_to Unjust Discourse_). Evil be unto you, if you touch\\nhim.\\n\\nCHORUS. A truce to your quarrellings and abuse! But expound, you, what\\nyou taught us formerly, and you, your new doctrine. Thus, after hearing\\neach of you argue, he will be able to choose betwixt the two schools.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. I am quite agreeable.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. And I too.\\n\\nCHORUS. Who is to speak first?\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Let it be my opponent, he has my full consent; then I\\nwill follow upon the very ground he shall have chosen and shall shatter\\nhim with a hail of new ideas and subtle fancies; if after that he dares\\nto breathe another word, I shall sting him in the face and in the eyes\\nwith our maxims, which are as keen as the sting of a wasp, and he will\\ndie.\\n\\nCHORUS. Here are two rivals confident in their powers of oratory and in\\nthe thoughts over which they have pondered so long. Let us see which will\\ncome triumphant out of the contest. This wisdom, for which my friends\\nmaintain such a persistent fight, is in great danger. Come then, you, who\\ncrowned men of other days with so many virtues, plead the cause dear to\\nyou, make yourself known to us.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Very well, I will tell you what was the old education,\\nwhen I used to teach justice with so much success and when modesty was\\nheld in veneration. Firstly, it was required of a child, that it should\\nnot utter a word. In the street, when they went to the music-school, all\\nthe youths of the same district marched lightly clad and ranged in good\\norder, even when the snow was falling in great flakes. At the master\\'s\\nhouse they had to stand, their legs apart, and they were taught to sing\\neither, \"Pallas, the Terrible, who overturneth cities,\" or \"A noise\\nresounded from afar\"[550] in the solemn tones of the ancient harmony. If\\nanyone indulged in buffoonery or lent his voice any of the soft\\ninflexions, like those which to-day the disciples of Phrynis[551] take so\\nmuch pains to form, he was treated as an enemy of the Muses and\\nbelaboured with blows. In the wrestling school they would sit with\\noutstretched legs and without display of any indecency to the curious.\\nWhen they rose, they would smooth over the sand, so as to leave no trace\\nto excite obscene thoughts. Never was a child rubbed with oil below the\\nbelt; the rest of their bodies thus retained its fresh bloom and down,\\nlike a velvety peach. They were not to be seen approaching a lover and\\nthemselves rousing his passion by soft modulation of the voice and\\nlustful gaze. At table, they would not have dared, before those older\\nthan themselves, to have taken a radish, an aniseed or a leaf of parsley,\\nand much less eat fish or thrushes or cross their legs.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. What antiquated rubbish! Have we got back to the days\\nof the festivals of Zeus Polieus,[552] to the Buphonia, to the time of\\nthe poet Cecydes[553] and the golden cicadas?[554]\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. \\'Tis nevertheless by suchlike teaching I built up the men\\nof Marathon. But you, you teach the children of to-day to bundle\\nthemselves quickly into their clothes, and I am enraged when I see them\\nat the Panathenaea forgetting Athené while they dance, and covering\\nthemselves with their bucklers. Hence, young man, dare to range yourself\\nbeside me, who follow justice and truth; you will then be able to shun\\nthe public place, to refrain from the baths, to blush at all that is\\nshameful, to fire up if your virtue is mocked at, to give place to your\\nelders, to honour your parents, in short, to avoid all that is evil. Be\\nmodesty itself, and do not run to applaud the dancing girls; if you\\ndelight in such scenes, some courtesan will cast you her apple and your\\nreputation will be done for. Do not bandy words with your father, nor\\ntreat him as a dotard, nor reproach the old man, who has cherished you,\\nwith his age.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. If you listen to him, by Bacchus! you will be the image\\nof the sons of Hippocrates[555] and will be called _mother\\'s great\\nninny_.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. No, but you will pass your days at the gymnasia, glowing\\nwith strength and health; you will not go to the public place to cackle\\nand wrangle as is done nowadays; you will not live in fear that you may\\nbe dragged before the courts for some trifle exaggerated by quibbling.\\nBut you will go down to the Academy[556] to run beneath the sacred olives\\nwith some virtuous friend of your own age, your head encircled with the\\nwhite reed, enjoying your ease and breathing the perfume of the yew and\\nof the fresh sprouts of the poplar, rejoicing in the return of springtide\\nand gladly listening to the gentle rustle of the plane-tree and the elm.\\nIf you devote yourself to practising my precepts, your chest will be\\nstout, your colour glowing, your shoulders broad, your tongue short, your\\nhips muscular, but your penis small. But if you follow the fashions of\\nthe day, you will be pallid in hue, have narrow shoulders, a narrow\\nchest, a long tongue, small hips and a big tool; you will know how to\\nspin forth long-winded arguments on law. You will be persuaded also to\\nregard as splendid everything that is shameful and as shameful everything\\nthat is honourable; in a word, you will wallow in debauchery like\\nAntimachus.[557]\\n\\nCHORUS. How beautiful, high-souled, brilliant is this wisdom that you\\npractise! What a sweet odour of honesty is emitted by your discourse!\\nHappy were those men of other days who lived when you were honoured! And\\nyou, seductive talker, come, find some fresh arguments, for your rival\\nhas done wonders. Bring out against him all the battery of your wit, if\\nyou desire to beat him and not to be laughed out of court.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. At last! I was choking with impatience, I was burning\\nto upset all his arguments! If I am called the Weaker Reasoning in the\\nschools, \\'tis precisely because I was the first before all others to\\ndiscover the means to confute the laws and the decrees of justice. To\\ninvoke solely the weaker arguments and yet triumph is a talent worth more\\nthan a hundred thousand drachmae. But see how I shall batter down the\\nsort of education of which he is so proud. Firstly, he forbids you to\\nbathe in hot water. What grounds have you for condemning hot baths?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Because they are baneful and enervate men.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Enough said! Oh! you poor wrestler! From the very\\noutset I have seized you and hold you round the middle; you cannot escape\\nme. Tell me, of all the sons of Zeus, who had the stoutest heart, who\\nperformed the most doughty deeds?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. None, in my opinion, surpassed Heracles.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Where have you ever seen cold baths called \\'Baths of\\nHeracles\\'?[558] And yet who was braver than he?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. \\'Tis because of such quibbles, that the baths are seen\\ncrowded with young folk, who chatter there the livelong day while the\\ngymnasia remain empty.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Next you condemn the habit of frequenting the\\nmarket-place, while I approve this. If it were wrong Homer would never\\nhave made Nestor[559] speak in public as well as all his wise heroes. As\\nfor the art of speaking, he tells you, young men should not practise it;\\nI hold the contrary. Furthermore he preaches chastity to them. Both\\nprecepts are equally harmful. Have you ever seen chastity of any use to\\nanyone? Answer and try to confute me.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. To many; for instance, Peleus won a sword thereby.[560]\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. A sword! Ah! what a fine present to make him! Poor\\nwretch! Hyperbolus, the lamp-seller, thanks to his villainy, has gained\\nmore than ... I do not know how many talents, but certainly no sword.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Peleus owed it to his chastity that he became the husband\\nof Thetis.[561]\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. ... who left him in the lurch, for he was not the most\\nardent; in those nocturnal sports between two sheets, which so please\\nwomen, he possessed but little merit. Get you gone, you are but an old\\nfool. But you, young man, just consider a little what this temperance\\nmeans and the delights of which it deprives you--young fellows, women,\\nplay, dainty dishes, wine, boisterous laughter. And what is life worth\\nwithout these? Then, if you happen to commit one of these faults inherent\\nin human weakness, some seduction or adultery, and you are caught in the\\nact, you are lost, if you cannot speak. But follow my teaching and you\\nwill be able to satisfy your passions, to dance, to laugh, to blush at\\nnothing. Are you surprised in adultery? Then up and tell the husband you\\nare not guilty, and recall to him the example of Zeus, who allowed\\nhimself to be conquered by love and by women. Being but a mortal, can you\\nbe stronger than a god?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. And if your pupil gets impaled, his hairs plucked out,\\nand he is seared with a hot ember,[562] how are you going to prove to him\\nthat he is not a filthy debauchee?\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. And wherein lies the harm of being so?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Is there anything worse than to have such a character?\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Now what will you say, if I beat you even on this\\npoint?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. I should certainly have to be silent then.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Well then, reply! Our advocates, what are they?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Low scum.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Nothing is more true. And our tragic poets?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Low scum.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Well said again. And our demagogues?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. Low scum.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. You admit that you have spoken nonsense. And the\\nspectators, what are they for the most part? Look at them.\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. I am looking at them.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Well! What do you see?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. By the gods, they are nearly all low scum. See, this one\\nI know to be such and that one and that other with the long hair.\\n\\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. What have you to say, then?\\n\\nJUST DISCOURSE. I am beaten. Debauchees! in the name of the gods, receive\\nmy cloak;[563] I pass over to your ranks.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Well then! do you take away your son or do you wish me to teach\\nhim how to speak?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Teach him, chastise him and do not fail to sharpen his\\ntongue well, on one side for petty law-suits and on the other for\\nimportant cases.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Make yourself easy, I shall return to you an accomplished\\nsophist.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Very pale then and thoroughly hang-dog-looking.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Take him with you.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. I do assure you, you will repent it.\\n\\nCHORUS. Judges, we are all about to tell you what you will gain by\\nawarding us the crown as equity requires of you. In spring, when you wish\\nto give your fields the first dressing, we will rain upon you first; the\\nothers shall wait. Then we will watch over your corn and over your\\nvine-stocks; they will have no excess to fear, neither of heat nor of\\nwet. But if a mortal dares to insult the goddesses of the Clouds, let him\\nthink of the ills we shall pour upon him. For him neither wine nor any\\nharvest at all! Our terrible slings will mow down his young olive plants\\nand his vines. If he is making bricks, it will rain, and our round\\nhailstones will break the tiles of his roof. If he himself marries or any\\nof his relations or friends, we shall cause rain to fall the whole night\\nlong. Verily, he would prefer to live in Egypt[564] than to have given\\nthis iniquitous verdict.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Another four, three, two days, then the eve, then the day,\\nthe fatal day of payment! I tremble, I quake, I shudder, for \\'tis the day\\nof the old moon and the new.[565] Then all my creditors take the oath,\\npay their deposits,[566] swear my downfall and my ruin. As for me, I\\nbeseech them to be reasonable, to be just, \"My friend, do not demand this\\nsum, wait a little for this other and give me time for this third one.\"\\nThen they will pretend that at this rate they will never be repaid, will\\naccuse me of bad faith and will threaten me with the law. Well then, let\\nthem sue me! I care nothing for that, if only Phidippides has learnt to\\nspeak fluently. I go to find out, let me knock at the door of the\\nschool.... Ho! slave, slave!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Welcome! Strepsiades!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Welcome! Socrates! But first take this sack (_offers him a\\nsack of flour_); it is right to reward the master with some present. And\\nmy son, whom you took off lately, has he learnt this famous reasoning,\\ntell me.\\n\\nSOCRATES. He has learnt it.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What a good thing! Oh! thou divine Knavery!\\n\\nSOCRATES. You will win just as many causes as you choose.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Even if I have borrowed before witnesses?\\n\\nSOCRATES. So much the better, even if there are a thousand of \\'em!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Then I am going to shout with all my might. \"Woe to the\\nusurers, woe to their capital and their interest and their compound\\ninterest! You shall play me no more bad turns. My son is being taught\\nthere, his tongue is being sharpened into a double-edged weapon; he is my\\ndefender, the saviour of my house, the ruin of my foes! His poor father\\nwas crushed down with misfortune and he delivers him.\" Go and call him to\\nme quickly. Oh! my child! my dear little one! run forward to your\\nfather\\'s voice!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Here he is.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, my friend, my dearest friend!\\n\\nSOCRATES. Take your son, and get you gone.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, my son! oh! oh! what a pleasure to see your pallor! You\\nare ready first to deny and then to contradict; \\'tis as clear as noon.\\nWhat a child of your country you are! How your lips quiver with the\\nfamous, \"What have you to say now?\" How well you know, I am certain, to\\nput on the look of a victim, when it is you who are making both victims\\nand dupes! and what a truly Attic glance! Come, \\'tis for you to save me,\\nseeing it is you who have ruined me.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. What is it you fear then?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. The day of the old and the new.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Is there then a day of the old and the new?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. The day on which they threaten to pay deposit against me.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Then so much the worse for those who have deposited! for\\n\\'tis not possible for one day to be two.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Why, undoubtedly, unless a woman can be both old and young\\nat the same time.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But so runs the law.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. I think the meaning of the law is quite misunderstood.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What does it mean?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Old Solon loved the people.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What has that to do with the old day and the new?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. He has fixed two days for the summons, the last day of the\\nold moon and the first day of the new; but the deposits must only be paid\\non the first day of the new moon.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And why did he also name the last day of the old?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. So, my dear sir, that the debtors, being there the day\\nbefore, might free themselves by mutual agreement, or that else, if not,\\nthe creditor might begin his action on the morning of the new moon.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why then do the magistrates have the deposits paid on the\\nlast of the month and not the next day?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. I think they do as the gluttons do, who are the first to\\npounce upon the dishes. Being eager to carry off these deposits, they\\nhave them paid in a day too soon.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Splendid! Ah! poor brutes,[567] who serve for food to us\\nclever folk! You are only down here to swell the number, true blockheads,\\nsheep for shearing, heap of empty pots! Hence I will sound the note of\\nvictory for my son and myself. \"Oh! happy, Strepsiades! what cleverness\\nis thine! and what a son thou hast here!\" Thus my friends and my\\nneighbours will say, jealous at seeing me gain all my suits. But come in,\\nI wish to regale you first.\\n\\nPASIAS (_to his witness_). A man should never lend a single obolus.\\n\\'Twould be better to put on a brazen face at the outset than to get\\nentangled in such matters. I want to see my money again and I bring you\\nhere to-day to attest the loan. I am going to make a foe of a neighbour;\\nbut, as long as I live, I do not wish my country to have to blush for me.\\nCome, I am going to summon Strepsiades.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Who is this?\\n\\nPASIAS. ... for the old day and the new.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I call you to witness, that he has named two days. What do\\nyou want of me?\\n\\nPASIAS. I claim of you the twelve minae, which you borrowed from me to\\nbuy the dapple-grey horse.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. A horse! do you hear him? I, who detest horses, as is well\\nknown.\\n\\nPASIAS. I call Zeus to witness, that you swore by the gods to return them\\nto me.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Because at that time, by Zeus! Phidippides did not yet know\\nthe irrefutable argument.\\n\\nPASIAS. Would you deny the debt on that account?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. If not, what use is his science to me?\\n\\nPASIAS. Will you dare to swear by the gods that you owe me nothing?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. By which gods?\\n\\nPASIAS. By Zeus, Hermes and Posidon!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why, I would give three obols for the pleasure of swearing\\nby them.\\n\\nPASIAS. Woe upon you, impudent knave!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! what a fine wine-skin you would make if flayed!\\n\\nPASIAS. Heaven! he jeers at me!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. It would hold six gallons easily.\\n\\nPASIAS. By great Zeus! by all the gods! you shall not scoff at me with\\nimpunity.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! how you amuse me with your gods! how ridiculous it seems\\nto a sage to hear Zeus invoked.\\n\\nPASIAS. Your blasphemies will one day meet their reward. But, come, will\\nyou repay me my money, yes or no? Answer me, that I may go.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Wait a moment, I am going to give you a distinct answer.\\n(_Goes indoors and returns immediately with a kneading-trough._)\\n\\nPASIAS. What do you think he will do?\\n\\nWITNESS. He will pay the debt.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Where is the man who demands money? Tell me, what is this?\\n\\nPASIAS. Him? Why he is your kneading-trough.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And you dare to demand money of me, when you are so\\nignorant? I will not return an obolus to anyone who says _him_ instead of\\n_her_ for a kneading-trough.\\n\\nPASIAS. You will not repay?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Not if I know it. Come, an end to this, pack off as quick as\\nyou can.\\n\\nPASIAS. I go, but, may I die, if it be not to pay my deposit for a\\nsummons.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Very well! \\'Twill be so much more to the bad to add to the\\ntwelve minae. But truly it makes me sad, for I do pity a poor simpleton\\nwho says _him_ for a kneading-trough.\\n\\nAMYNIAS. Woe! ah woe is me!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Hold! who is this whining fellow? Can it be one of the gods\\nof Carcinus?[568]\\n\\nAMYNIAS. Do you want to know who I am? I am a man of misfortune!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Get on your way then.\\n\\nAMYNIAS. Oh! cruel god! Oh Fate, who hath broken the wheels of my\\nchariot! Oh, Pallas, thou hast undone me![569]\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What ill has Tlepolemus done you?\\n\\nAMYNIAS. Instead of jeering me, friend, make your son return me the money\\nhe has had of me; I am already unfortunate enough.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What money?\\n\\nAMYNIAS. The money he borrowed of me.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. You have indeed had misfortune, it seems to me.\\n\\nAMYNIAS. Yes, by the gods! I have been thrown from a chariot.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why then drivel as if you had fallen from an ass?[570]\\n\\nAMYNIAS. Am I drivelling because I demand my money?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. No, no, you cannot be in your right senses.\\n\\nAMYNIAS. Why?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. No doubt your poor wits have had a shake.\\n\\nAMYNIAS. But by Hermes! I will sue you at law, if you do not pay me.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Just tell me; do you think it is always fresh water that\\nZeus lets fall every time it rains, or is it always the same water that\\nthe sun pumps over the earth?\\n\\nAMYNIAS. I neither know, nor care.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. And actually you would claim the right to demand your money,\\nwhen you know not a syllable of these celestial phenomena?\\n\\nAMYNIAS. If you are short, pay me the interest, at any rate.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What kind of animal is interest?\\n\\nAMYNIAS. What? Does not the sum borrowed go on growing, growing every\\nmonth, each day as the time slips by?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Well put. But do you believe there is more water in the sea\\nnow than there was formerly?\\n\\nAMYNIAS. No, \\'tis just the same quantity. It cannot increase.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Thus, poor fool, the sea, that receives the rivers, never\\ngrows, and yet you would have your money grow? Get you gone, away with\\nyou, quick! Ho! bring me the ox-goad!\\n\\nAMYNIAS. Hither! you witnesses there!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Come, what are you waiting for? Will you not budge, old nag!\\n\\nAMYNIAS. What an insult!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Unless you get a-trotting, I shall catch you and prick up\\nyour behind, you sorry packhorse! Ah! you start, do you? I was about to\\ndrive you pretty fast, I tell you--you and your wheels and your chariot!\\n\\nCHORUS. Whither does the passion of evil lead! here is a perverse old\\nman, who wants to cheat his creditors; but some mishap, which will\\nspeedily punish this rogue for his shameful schemings, cannot fail to\\novertake him from to-day. For a long time he has been burning to have his\\nson know how to fight against all justice and right and to gain even the\\nmost iniquitous causes against his adversaries every one. I think this\\nwish is going to be fulfilled. But mayhap, mayhap, he will soon wish his\\nson were dumb rather!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! oh! neighbours, kinsmen, fellow-citizens, help! help! to\\nthe rescue, I am being beaten! Oh! my head! oh! my jaw! Scoundrel! do you\\nbeat your own father!\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Yes, father, I do.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. See! he admits he is beating me.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Undoubtedly I do.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. You villain, you parricide, you gallows-bird!\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Go on, repeat your epithets, call me a thousand other names,\\nan it please you. The more you curse, the greater my amusement!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! you infamous cynic!\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. How fragrant the perfume breathed forth in your words.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Do you beat your own father?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Aye, by Zeus! and I am going to show you that I do right in\\nbeating you.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, wretch! can it be right to beat a father?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. I will prove it to you, and you shall own yourself\\nvanquished.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Own myself vanquished on a point like this?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. \\'Tis the easiest thing in the world. Choose whichever of the\\ntwo reasonings you like.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Of which reasonings?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. The Stronger and the Weaker.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Miserable fellow! Why, \\'tis I who had you taught how to\\nrefute what is right, and now you would persuade me it is right a son\\nshould beat his father.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. I think I shall convince you so thoroughly that, when you\\nhave heard me, you will not have a word to say.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Well, I am curious to hear what you have to say.\\n\\nCHORUS. Consider well, old man, how you can best triumph over him. His\\nbrazenness shows me that he thinks himself sure of his case; he has some\\nargument which gives him nerve. Note the confidence in his look! But how\\ndid the fight begin? tell the Chorus; you cannot help doing that much.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I will tell you what was the start of the quarrel. At the\\nend of the meal you wot of, I bade him take his lyre and sing me the air\\nof Simonides, which tells of the fleece of the ram.[571] He replied\\nbluntly, that it was stupid, while drinking, to play the lyre and sing,\\nlike a woman when she is grinding barley.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Why, by rights I ought to have beaten and kicked you the\\nvery moment you told me to sing!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. That is just how he spoke to me in the house, furthermore he\\nadded, that Simonides was a detestable poet. However, I mastered myself\\nand for a while said nothing. Then I said to him, \\'At least, take a\\nmyrtle branch and recite a passage from Aeschylus to me.\\'--\\'For my own\\npart,\\' he at once replied, \\'I look upon Aeschylus as the first of poets,\\nfor his verses roll superbly; \\'tis nothing but incoherence, bombast and\\nturgidness.\\' Yet still I smothered my wrath and said, \\'Then recite one of\\nthe famous pieces from the modern poets.\\' Then he commenced a piece in\\nwhich Euripides shows, oh! horror! a brother, who violates his own\\nuterine sister.[572] Then I could no longer restrain myself, and attacked\\nhim with the most injurious abuse; naturally he retorted; hard words were\\nhurled on both sides, and finally he sprang at me, broke my bones, bore\\nme to earth, strangled and started killing me!\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. I was right. What! not praise Euripides, the greatest of our\\npoets!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. He the greatest of our poets! Ah! if I but dared to speak!\\nbut the blows would rain upon me harder than ever.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Undoubtedly, and rightly too.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Rightly! oh! what impudence! to me, who brought you up! when\\nyou could hardly lisp, I guessed what you wanted. If you said _broo,\\nbroo_, well, I brought you your milk; if you asked for _mam mam_, I gave\\nyou bread; and you had no sooner said, _caca_, than I took you outside\\nand held you out. And just now, when you were strangling me, I shouted, I\\nbellowed that I would let all go; and you, you scoundrel, had not the\\nheart to take me outside, so that here, though almost choking, I was\\ncompelled to ease myself.\\n\\nCHORUS. Young men, your hearts must be panting with impatience. What is\\nPhidippides going to say? If, after such conduct, he proves he has done\\nwell, I would not give an obolus for the hide of old men. Come, you, who\\nknow how to brandish and hurl the keen shafts of the new science, find a\\nway to convince us, give your language an appearance of truth.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. How pleasant it is to know these clever new inventions and\\nto be able to defy the established laws! When I thought only about\\nhorses, I was not able to string three words together without a mistake,\\nbut now that the master has altered and improved me and that I live in\\nthis world of subtle thought, of reasoning and of meditation, I count on\\nbeing able to prove satisfactorily that I have done well to thrash my\\nfather.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Mount your horse! By Zeus! I would rather defray the keep of\\na four-in-hand team than be battered with blows.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. I revert to what I was saying when you interrupted me. And\\nfirst, answer me, did you beat me in my childhood?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why, assuredly, for your good and in your own best interest.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Tell me, is it not right, that in turn I should beat you for\\nyour good? since it is for a man\\'s own best interest to be beaten. What!\\nmust your body be free of blows, and not mine? am I not free-born too?\\nthe children are to weep and the fathers go free?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But...\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. You will tell me, that according to the law, \\'tis the lot of\\nchildren to be beaten. But I reply that the old men are children twice\\nover and that it is far more fitting to chastise them than the young, for\\nthere is less excuse for their faults.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But the law nowhere admits that fathers should be treated\\nthus.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Was not the legislator who carried this law a man like you\\nand me? In those days he got men to believe him; then why should not I\\ntoo have the right to establish for the future a new law, allowing\\nchildren to beat their fathers in turn? We make you a present of all the\\nblows which were received before this law, and admit that you thrashed us\\nwith impunity. But look how the cocks and other animals fight with their\\nfathers; and yet what difference is there betwixt them and ourselves,\\nunless it be that they do not propose decrees?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. But if you imitate the cocks in all things, why don\\'t you\\nscratch up the dunghill, why don\\'t you sleep on a perch?\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. That has no bearing on the case, good sir; Socrates would\\nfind no connection, I assure you.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Then do not beat at all, for otherwise you have only\\nyourself to blame afterwards.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. What for?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I have the right to chastise you, and you to chastise your\\nson, if you have one.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. And if I have not, I shall have cried in vain, and you will\\ndie laughing in my face.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What say you, all here present? It seems to me that he is\\nright, and I am of opinion that they should be accorded their right. If\\nwe think wrongly, \\'tis but just we should be beaten.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Again, consider this other point.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. \\'Twill be the death of me.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. But you will certainly feel no more anger because of the\\nblows I have given you.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Come, show me what profit I shall gain from it.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. I shall beat my mother just as I have you.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What do you say? what\\'s that you say? Hah! this is far worse\\nstill.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. And what if I prove to you by our school reasoning, that one\\nought to beat one\\'s mother?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! if you do that, then you will only have to throw\\nyourself along with Socrates and his reasoning, into the Barathrum.[573]\\nOh! Clouds! all our troubles emanate from you, from you, to whom I\\nentrusted myself, body and soul.\\n\\nCHORUS. No, you alone are the cause, because you have pursued the path of\\nevil.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why did you not say so then, instead of egging on a poor\\nignorant old man?\\n\\nCHORUS. We always act thus, when we see a man conceive a passion for what\\nis evil; we strike him with some terrible disgrace, so that he may learn\\nto fear the gods.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Alas! oh Clouds! \\'tis hard indeed, but \\'tis just! I ought\\nnot to have cheated my creditors.... But come, my dear son, come with me\\nto take vengeance on this wretched Chaerephon and on Socrates, who have\\ndeceived us both.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. I shall do nothing against our masters.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! show some reverence for ancestral Zeus!\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Mark him and his ancestral Zeus! What a fool you are! Does\\nany such being as Zeus exist?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Why, assuredly.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. No, a thousand times no! The ruler of the world is the\\nWhirlwind, that has unseated Zeus.\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. He has not dethroned him. I believed it, because of this\\nwhirligig here. Unhappy wretch that I am! I have taken a piece of clay to\\nbe a god.\\n\\nPHIDIPPIDES. Very well! Keep your stupid nonsense for your own\\nconsumption. (_Exit_.)\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! what madness! I had lost my reason when I threw over the\\ngods through Socrates\\' seductive phrases. Oh! good Hermes, do not destroy\\nme in your wrath. Forgive me; their babbling had driven me crazy. Be my\\ncouncillor. Shall I pursue them at law or shall I...? Order and I\\nobey.--You are right, no law-suit; but up! let us burn down the home of\\nthose praters. Here, Xanthias, here! take a ladder, come forth and arm\\nyourself with an axe; now mount upon the school, demolish the roof, if\\nyou love your master, and may the house fall in upon them, Ho! bring me a\\nblazing torch! There is more than one of them, arch-impostors as they\\nare, on whom I am determined to have vengeance.\\n\\nA DISCIPLE. Oh! oh!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. Come, torch, do your duty! Burst into full flame!\\n\\nDISCIPLE. What are you up to?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. What am I up to? Why, I am entering upon a subtle argument\\nwith the beams of the house.\\n\\nSECOND DISCIPLE. Hullo! hullo! who is burning down our house?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. The man whose cloak you have appropriated.\\n\\nSECOND DISCIPLE. But we are dead men, dead men!\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. That is just exactly what I hope, unless my axe plays me\\nfalse, or I fall and break my neck.\\n\\nSOCRATES. Hi! you fellow on the roof, what are you doing up there?\\n\\nSTREPSIADES. I traverse the air and contemplate the sun.[574]\\n\\nSOCRATES. Ah! ah! woe is upon me! I am suffocating!\\n\\nCHAEREPHON. Ah! you insulted the gods! Ah! you studied the face of the\\nmoon! Chase them, strike and beat them down! Forward! they have richly\\ndeserved their fate--above all, by reason of their blasphemies.\\n\\nCHORUS. So let the Chorus file off the stage. Its part is played.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFINIS OF \"THE CLOUDS\"', '\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTHE WASPS\\n\\n\\nSOSIAS. Why, Xanthias! what are you doing, wretched man?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. I am teaching myself how to rest; I have been awake and on\\nwatch the whole night.\\n\\nSOSIAS. So you want to earn trouble for your ribs,[1] eh? Don\\'t you know\\nwhat sort of an animal we are guarding here?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Aye indeed! but I want to put my cares to sleep for a while.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Beware what you do. I too feel soft sleep spreading over my eyes.\\nResist it, for you must be as mad as a Corybant if you fall asleep.[2]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. No! \\'Tis Bacchus who lulls me off.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Then you serve the same god as myself. Just now a heavy slumber\\nsettled on my eyelids like a hostile Mede; A nodded and, faith! I had a\\nwondrous dream.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Indeed! and so had I. A dream such as I never had before. But\\nfirst tell me yours.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Methinks I saw an eagle, a gigantic bird, descend upon the\\nmarket-place; it seized a brazen buckler with its talons and bore it away\\ninto the highest heavens; then I saw \\'twas Cleonymus had thrown it away.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. This Cleonymus is a riddle worth propounding among guests. How\\ncan one and the same animal have cast away his buckler both on land, in\\nthe sky and at sea?[3]\\n\\nSOSIAS. Alas!  what ill does such a dream portend for me?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Rest undisturbed! An it please the gods, no evil will befall\\nyou.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Nevertheless, \\'tis a fatal omen when a man throws away his\\nweapons. But what was your dream? Let me hear.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh! it is a dream of high import. It has reference to the hull\\nof the State; to nothing less.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Tell it me quickly; show me its very keel.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. In my first slumber I thought I saw sheep, wearing cloaks and\\ncarrying staves,[4] met in assembly on the Pnyx; a rapacious whale was\\nharanguing them and screaming like a pig that is being grilled.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Faugh! faugh!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nSOSIAS. Enough, enough, spare me. Your dream stinks vilely of old\\nleather.[5]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Then this scoundrelly whale seized a balance and set to\\nweighing ox-fat.[6]\\n\\nSOSIAS. Alas! \\'tis our poor Athenian people, whom this accursed beast\\nwished to cut up and despoil of their fat.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Seated on the ground close to it, I saw Theorus,[7] who had the\\nhead of a crow. The Alcibiades said to me in his lisping way, \"Do you\\nthee? Theoruth hath a crow\\'th head.\"[8]\\n\\nSOSIAS. Ah! \\'twas very well lisped indeed!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. This is might strange; Theorus turning into a crow!\\n\\nSOSIAS. No, it is glorious.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Why?\\n\\nSOSIAS. Why? He was a man and now he has suddenly become a crow; does it\\nnot foretoken that he will take his flight from here and go to the\\ncrows?[9]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Interpreting dreams so aptly certainly deserves two obols.[10]\\n\\nSOSIAS. Come, I must explain the matter to the spectators. But first a\\nfew words of preamble: expect nothing very high-flown from us, nor any\\njests stolen from Megara;[11] we have no slaves, who throw baskets of\\nnuts[12] to the spectators, nor any Heracles to be robbed of his\\ndinner,[13] nor is Euripides loaded with contumely; and despite the happy\\nchance that gave Cleon his fame[14] we shall not go out of our way to\\nbelabour him again. Our little subject is not wanting in sense; it is\\nwell within your capacity and at the same time cleverer than many vulgar\\nComedies.--We have a master of great renown, who is now sleeping up there\\non the other story. He has bidden us keep guard over his father, whom he\\nhas locked in, so that he may not go out. This father has a curious\\ncomplaint; not one of you could hit upon or guess it, if I did not tell\\nyou.--Well then, try! I hear Amynias, the son of Pronapus, over there,\\nsaying, \"He is addicted to gambling.\"\\n\\nXANTHIAS. He\\'s wrong! He is imputing his own malady to others.\\n\\nSOSIAS. No, yet love is indeed the principal part of his disease. Ah!\\nhere is Sosias telling Dercylus, \"He loves drinking.\"\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Not at all! The love of wine is the complaint of good men.\\n\\nSOSIAS. \"Well then,\" says Nicostratus of the Scambonian deme, \"he either\\nloves sacrifices or else strangers.\"\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Ah! great gods! no, he is not fond of strangers, Nicostratus,\\nfor he who says \"Philoxenus\" means a dirty fellow.[15]\\n\\nSOSIAS. \\'Tis mere waste of time, you will not find it out. If you want to\\nknow it, keep silence! I will tell you our master\\'s complaint: of all\\nmen, it is he who is fondest of the Heliaea.[16] Thus, to be judging is\\nhis hobby, and he groans if he is not sitting on the first seat. He does\\nnot close an eye at night, and if he dozes off for an instant his mind\\nflies instantly to the clepsydra.[17] He is so accustomed to hold the\\nballoting pebble, that he awakes with his three fingers pinched\\ntogether[18] as if he were offering incense to the new moon. If he sees\\nscribbled on some doorway, \"How charming is Demos,[19] the son of\\nPyrilampes!\" he will write beneath it, \"How charming is Cemos!\"[20] His\\ncock crowed one evening; said he, \"He has had money from the accused to\\nawaken me too late.\"[21] As soon as he rises from supper he bawls for his\\nshoes and away he rushes down there before dawn to sleep beforehand,\\nglued fast to the column like an oyster.[22] He is a merciless judge,\\nnever failing to draw the convicting line[23] and return home with his\\nnails full of wax like a bumble-bee. Fearing he might run short of\\npebbles[24] he keeps enough at home to cover a sea-beach, so that he may\\nhave the means of recording his sentence. Such is his madness, and all\\nadvice is useless; he only judges the more each day. So we keep him under\\nlock and key, to prevent his going out; for his son is broken-hearted\\nover this mania. At first he tried him with gentleness, wanted to\\npersuade him to wear the cloak no longer,[25] to go out no more; unable\\nto convince him, he had him bathed and purified according to the\\nritual[26] without any greater success, and then handed him over the the\\nCorybantes;[27] but the old man escaped them, and carrying off the\\nkettle-drum,[28] rushed right into the midst of the Heliasts. As Cybelé\\ncould do nothing with her rites, his son took him again to Aegina and\\nforcibly made him lie one night in the temple of Asclepius, the God of\\nHealing, but before daylight there he was to be seen at the gate of the\\ntribunal. Since then we let him go out no more, but he escaped us by the\\ndrains or by the skylights, so we stuffed up every opening with old rags\\nand made all secure; then he drove short sticks into the wall and sprang\\nfrom rung to rung like a magpie. Now we have stretched nets all round the\\ncourt and we keep watch and ward. The old man\\'s name is Philocleon,[29]\\n\\'tis the best name he could have, and the son is called Bdelycleon,[30]\\nfor he is a man very fit to cure an insolent fellow of his boasting.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Xanthias! Sosias! Are you asleep?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh! oh!\\n\\nSOSIAS. What is the matter?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Why, Bdelycleon is rising.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Will neither of you come here?  My father has got into the\\nstove-chamber and is ferreting about like a rat in his hole. Take care he\\ndoes not escape through the bath drain. You there, put all your weight\\nagainst the door.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Aye, aye, master.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. By Zeus!  what is that noise in the chimney?  Hullo! who are\\nyou?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I am the smoke going up.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Smoke?  smoke of what wood?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Of fig-wood.[31]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Ah!  \\'this the most acrid of all. But you shall not get out.\\nWhere is the chimney cover?[32] Come down again. Now, up with another\\ncross-bar. Now look out some fresh dodge. But am I not the most\\nunfortunate of men? Henceforward, I shall only be called the son of the\\nsmoky old man. Slave, hold the door stoutly, throw your weight upon it,\\ncome, put heart into the work. I will come and help you. Watch both lock\\nand bolt. Take care he does not gnaw through the peg.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. What are you dong, you wretches?  Let me go out; it is\\nimperative that I go and judge, or Dracontides will be acquitted.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. What a dreadful calamity for you!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Once at Delphi, the god, whom I was consulting, foretold,\\nthat if an accused man escaped me, I should die of consumption.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Apollo, the Saviour, what a prophecy!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah!  I beseech you, if you do not want my death, let me go.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. No, Philocleon, no never, by Posidon!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Well then, I shall gnaw through the net[33] with my teeth.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. But you have no teeth.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh! you rascal, how can I kill you?  How?  Give me a sword,\\nquick, or a conviction tablet.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Our friend is planning some great crime.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. No, by Zeus!  but I want to go and sell my ass and its\\npanniers, for \\'this the first of the month.[34]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Could I not sell it just as well?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Not as well as I could.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. No, but better. Come, bring it here, bring it here by all\\nmeans--if you can.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What a clever excuse he has found now!  What cunning to get you\\nto let him go out!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Yes, but I have not swallowed the hook; I scented the trick.\\nI will go in and fetch the ass, so that the old man may not point his\\nweapons that way again....[35] Stupid old ass, are you weeping because\\nyou are going to be sold? Come, go a bit quicker. Why, what are you\\nmoaning and groaning for?  You might be carrying another Odysseus.[36]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Why, certainly, so he is!  someone has crept beneath his belly.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Who, who?  Let us see.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. \\'Tis he.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. What does this mean?  Who are you?  Come, speak!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I am Nobody.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Nobody?  Of what country?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Of Ithaca, son of Apodrasippides.[37]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Ha!  Mister Nobody, you will not laugh presently. Pull him\\nout quick!  Ah!  the wretch, where has be crept to? Does he not resemble\\na she-ass to the life?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. If you do not leave me in peace, I shall commence\\nproceedings.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. And what will the suit be about?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. The shade of an ass.[38]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. You are a poor man of very little wit, but thoroughly brazen.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. A poor man!  Ah!  by Zeus!  you know not now what I am worth;\\nbut you will know when you disembowel the old Heliast\\'s money bag.[39]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Come, get back indoors, both you and your ass.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh! my brethren of the tribunal! oh! Cleon! to the rescue!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Go and bawl in there under lock and key. And you there, pile\\nplenty of stones against the door, thrust the bolt home into the staple,\\nand to keep this beam in its place roll that great mortar against it.\\nQuick\\'s the word.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Oh! my god! whence did this brick fall on me?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Perhaps a rat loosened it.\\n\\nSOSIAS. A rat? \\'tis surely our gutter-judge,[40] who has crept beneath\\nthe tiles of the roof.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Ah! woe to us! there he is, he has turned into a sparrow; he\\nwill be flying off. Where is the net? where? pschit! pschit! get back!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Ah! by Zeus! I would rather have to guard Scioné[41] than\\nsuch a father.\\n\\nSOSIAS. And how that we have driven him in thoroughly and he can no\\nlonger escape without our knowledge, can we not have a few winks of\\nsleep, no matter how few?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Why, wretch! the other jurymen will be here almost directly\\nto summon my father!\\n\\nSOSIAS. Why, \\'tis scarcely dawn yet!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Ah, they must have risen late to-day. Generally it is the\\nmiddle of the night when they come to fetch him. They arrive here,\\ncarrying lanterns in their hands and singing the charming old verses of\\nPhrynichus\\' \"Sidonian Women\";[42] \\'tis their way of calling him.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Well, if need be, we will chase them off with stones.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. What!  you dare to speak so?  Why, this class of old men, if\\nirritated, becomes as terrible as a swarm of wasps. They carry below\\ntheir loins the sharpest of stings, with which to sting their foe; they\\nshout and leap and their stings burn like so many sparks.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Have no fear!  If I can find stones to throw into this nest of\\njurymen-wasps, I shall soon have them cleared off.\\n\\nCHORUS. March on, advance boldly and bravely!  Comias, your feet are\\ndragging; once you were as tough as a dog-skin strap and now even\\nCharinades walks better than you. Ha!  Strymodorus of Conthylé, you best\\nof mates, where is Euergides and where is Chales of Phyla?  Ha, ha,\\nbravo! there you are, the last of the lads with whom we mounted guard\\ntogether at Byzantium.[43] Do you remember how, one night, prowling\\nround, we noiselessly stole the kneading-trough of a baker\\'s-wife; we\\nsplit it in two and cooked our green-stuff with it.--But let us hasten,\\nfor the case of the Laches[44] comes on to-day, and they all say he has\\nembezzled a pot of money. Hence Cleon, our protector, advised us\\nyesterday to come early and with a three days\\' stock of fiery rage so as\\nto chastise him for his crimes. Let us hurry, comrades, before it is\\nlight; come, let us search every nook with our lanterns to see whether\\nthose who wish us ill have not set us some trap.\\n\\nBOY. Ah!  here is mud!  Father, take care!\\n\\nCHORUS. Pick up a blade of straw and trim the lamp of your lantern.\\n\\nBOY. No, I can trim it quite well with my finger.\\n\\nCHORUS. Why do you pull out the wick, you little dolt?  Oil is scarce,\\nand \\'tis not you who suffer when it has to be paid for. (_Strikes him._)\\n\\nBOY. If you teach us again with your fists, we shall put out the lamps\\nand go home; then you will have no light and will squatter about in the\\nmud like ducks in the dark.\\n\\nCHORUS. I know how to punish other offenders bigger than you. But I think\\nI am treading in some mud. Oh! \\'tis certain it will rain in torrents for\\nfour days at least; look, what thieves are in our lamps; that is always\\na sign of heavy rain; but the rain and the north wind will be good for\\nthe crops that are still standing.... Why, what can have happened to our\\nmate, who lives here?  Why does he not come to join our party?  There\\nused to be no need to haul him in our wake, for he would march at our\\nhead singing the verses of Phrynichus; he was a lover of singing. Should\\nwe not, friends, make a halt here and sign to call him out?  The charm of\\nmy voice will fetch him out, if he hears it.\\n\\nWhy does the old man not show himself before the door?  why does he not\\nanswer?  Has he lost his shoes? has he stubbed his toe in the dark and\\nthus got a swollen ankle?  Perhaps he has a tumour in his groin. He was\\nthe hardest of us all; he alone _never_ allowed himself to be moved. If\\nanyone tried to move him, he would lower his head, saying, \"You might\\njust as well try to boil a stone.\" But I bethink me, an accused ma\\nescaped us yesterday through his false pretence that he loved Athens and\\nhad been the first to unfold the Samian plot.[45] Perhaps his acquittal\\nhas so distressed Philocleon that he is abed with fever--he is quite\\ncapable of such a thing.--Friend, arise, do not thus vex your heart, but\\nforget your wrath. Today we have to judge a man made wealthy by treason,\\none of those who set Thrace free;[46] we have to prepare him a funeral\\nurn ... so march on, my boy, get a-going.\\n\\nBOY. Father, would you give me something if I asked for it?\\n\\nCHORUS. Assuredly, my child, but tell me what nice thing do you want me\\nto buy you?  A set of knuckle-bones, I suppose.\\n\\nBOY. No, dad, I prefer figs; they are better.\\n\\nCHORUS. No, by Zeus! even if you were to hang yourself with vexation.\\n\\nBOY. Well then, I will lead you no father.\\n\\nCHORUS. With my small pay, I am obliged to buy bread, wood, stew; and now\\nyou ask me for figs!\\n\\nBOY. But, father, if the Archon[47] should not form a court to-day, how\\nare we to buy our dinner? Have you some good hope to offer us or merely\\n\"Hellé\\'s sacred waves\"?[48]\\n\\nCHORUS. Alas! alas! I have not a notion how we shall dine.\\n\\nBOY. Oh! my poor mother! why did you let me see this day?\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! my little wallet! you seem like to be a mere useless\\nornament!\\n\\nBOY. \\'Tis our destiny to groan.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON.[49] My friends, I have long been pining away while listening\\nto you from my window, but I absolutely know not what do do. I am\\ndetained here, because I have long wanted to go with you to the law court\\nand do all the harm I can. Oh! Zeus! cause the peals of they thunder to\\nroll, change me quickly into smoke or make me into a Proxenides, a\\nperfect braggart, like the son of Sellus. Oh, King of Heaven! hesitate\\nnot to grant me this favour, pity my misfortune or else may thy dazzling\\nlightning instantly reduce me to ashes; then carry me hence, and may thy\\nbreath hurl me into some burning pickle[50] or turn me into one of the\\nstones on which the votes are counted.\\n\\nCHORUS. Who is it detains you and shuts you in? Speak, for you are\\ntalking to friends.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. \\'Tis my son. But no bawling, he is there in front asleep;\\nlower your voice.\\n\\nCHORUS. But, poor fellow, what is his aim? what is his object?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. My friends, he will not have me judge nor do anyone any ill,\\nbut he wants me to stay at home and enjoy myself, and I will not.\\n\\nCHORUS. This wretch, this Demolochocleon[51] dares to say such odious\\nthings, just because you tell the truth about our navy!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. He would not have dared, had he not been a conspirator.\\n\\nCHORUS. Meanwhile, you must devise some new dodge, so that you can come\\ndown here without his knowledge.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But what? Try to find some way. For myself, I am ready for\\nanything, so much do I burn to run along the tiers of the tribunal with\\nmy voting-pebble in my hand.\\n\\nCHORUS. There is surely some hole through which you could manage to\\nsqueeze from within, and escape dressed in rags, like the crafty\\nOdysseus.[52]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Everything is sealed fast; not so much as a gnat could get\\nthrough. Think of some other plan; there is no possible hold of escape.\\n\\nCHORUS. Do you recall how, when you were with the army at the taking of\\nNaxos,[53] you descended so readily from the top of the wall by means of\\nthe spits you have stolen?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I remember that well enough, but what connection is there\\nwith present circumstances? I was young, clever at thieving, I had all my\\nstrength, none watched over me, and I could run off without fear. But\\nto-day men-at-arms are placed at every outlet to watch me, and two of\\nthem are lying in wait for me at this very door armed with spits, just as\\nfolk lie in wait for a cat that has stolen a piece of meat.\\n\\nCHORUS. Come, discover some way as quick as possible. Here is the dawn\\ncome, my dear little friend.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. The best way is to gnaw through the net. Oh! goddess, who\\nwatches over the nets,[54] forgive me for making a hole in this one.\\n\\nCHORUS. \\'Tis acting like a man eager for his safety. Get your jaws to\\nwork!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. There! \\'tis gnawed through! But no shouting! let Bdelycleon\\nnotice nothing!\\n\\nCHORUS. Have no fear, have no fear! if he breathes a syllable, \\'twill be\\nto bruise his own knuckles; he will have to fight to defend his own head.\\nWe shall teach him not to insult the mysteries of the goddesses.[55] But\\nfasten a rope to the window, tie it around your body and let yourself\\ndown to the ground, with your heart bursting with the fury of\\nDiopithes.[56]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But if these notice it and want to fish me up and drag me\\nback into the house, what will you do? Tell me that.\\n\\nCHORUS. We shall call up the full strength of out courage to your aid.\\nThat is what we will do.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I trust myself to you and risk the danger. If misfortune\\novertakes me, take away my body, bathe it with your tears and bury it\\nbeneath the bar of the tribunal.\\n\\nCHORUS. Nothing will happen to you, rest assured. Come friend, have\\ncourage and let yourself slide down while you invoke your country\\'s gods.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh! mighty Lycus![57] noble hero and my neighbour, thou, like\\nmyself, takest pleasure in the tears and the groans of the accused. If\\nthou art come to live near the tribunal, \\'tis with the express design of\\nhearing them incessantly; thou alone of all the heroes hast wished to\\nremain among those who weep. Have pity on me and save him, who lives\\nclose to thee; I swear I will never make water, never, nor relieve my\\nbelly with a fart against the railing of thy statue.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Ho there! ho! get up!\\n\\nSOSIAS. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Methought I heard talking close to me.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Is the old man at it again, escaping through some loophole?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. No, by Zeus! no, but he is letting himself down by a rope.\\n\\nSOSIAS. Ha, rascal! what are you doing there? You shall not descend.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Mount quick to the other window, strike him with the boughs\\nthat hang over the entrance; perchance he will turn back when he feels\\nhimself being thrashed.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. To the rescue! all you, who are going to have lawsuits this\\nyear--Smicythion, Tisiades, Chremon and Pheredipnus. \\'Tis now or never,\\nbefore they force me to return, that you must help.\\n\\nCHORUS. Why do we delay to let loose that fury, that is so terrible, when\\nour nests are attacked? I feel my angry sting is stiffening, that sharp\\nsting, with which we punish our enemies. Come, children, cast your cloaks\\nto the winds, run, shout, tell Cleon what is happening, that he may march\\nagainst this foe to our city, who deserves death, since he proposes to\\nprevent the trial of lawsuits.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Friends, listen to the truth, instead of bawling.\\n\\nCHORUS. By Zeus! we will shout to heaven and never forsake our friend.\\nWhy, this is intolerable, \\'tis manifest tyranny. Oh! citizens, oh!\\nTheorus,[58] the enemy of the gods! and all you flatterers, who rule us!\\ncome to our aid.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. By Heracles! they have stings. Do you see them, master?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. \\'Twas with these weapons that they killed Philippus the son\\nof Gorgias[59] when he was put on trial.\\n\\nCHORUS. And you too shall die. Turn yourselves this way, all, with your\\nstings out for attack and throw yourselves upon him in good and serried\\norder, and swelled up with wrath and rage. Let him learn to know the sort\\nof foes he has dared to irritate.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. The fight will be fast and furious, by great Zeus! I tremble at\\nthe sight of their stings.\\n\\nCHORUS. Let this man go, unless you want to envy the tortoise his hard\\nshell.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Come, my dear companions, wasps with relentless hearts, fly\\nagainst him, animated with your fury. Sting him in the back, in his eyes\\nand on his fingers.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Midas, Phryx, Masyntias, here! Come and help. Seize this man\\nand hand him over to no one, otherwise you shall starve to death in\\nchains. Fear nothing, I have often heard the crackling of fig-leaves in\\nthe fire.[60]\\n\\nCHORUS. If you won\\'t let him go, I shall bury this sting in your body.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh, Cecrops, mighty hero with the tail of a dragon! Seest\\nthou how these barbarians ill-use me--me, who have many a time made them\\nweep a full bushel of tears?\\n\\nCHORUS. Is not old age filled with cruel ills? What violence these two\\nslaves offer to their old master! they have forgotten all bygones, the\\nfur-coats and the jackets and the caps he bought for them; in winter he\\nwatched that their feet should not get frozen. And only see them now;\\nthere is no gentleness in their look nor any recollection of the slippers\\nof other days.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Will you let me go, you accursed animal? Don\\'t you remember\\nthe day when I surprised you stealing the grapes; I tied you to an\\nolive-tree and I cut open your bottom with such vigorous lashes that\\nfolks thought you had been pedicated. Get away, you are ungrateful. But\\nlet go of me, and you too, before my son comes up.\\n\\nCHORUS. You shall repay us for all this and \\'twill not be long first.\\nTremble at our ferocious glance; you shall taste our just anger.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Strike! strike, Xanthias! Drive these wasps away from the\\nhouse.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. That\\'s just what I am doing; but do you smoke them out\\nthoroughly too.\\n\\nSOSIAS. You will not go? The plague seize you! Will you not clear off?\\nXanthias, strike them with your stick!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And you, to smoke them out better, throw Aeschinus, the son of\\nSelartius, on the fire. Ah! we were bound to drive you off in the end.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Eh! by Zeus! you would not have put them to flight so easily\\nif they had fed on the verses of Philocles.\\n\\nCHORUS. It is clear to all the poor that tyranny has attacked us sorely.\\nProud emulator of Amynias, you, who only take pleasure in doing ill, see\\nhow you are preventing us from obeying the laws of the city; you do not\\neven seek a pretext or any plausible excuse, but claim to rule alone.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Hold! A truce to all blows and brawling! Had we not better\\nconfer together and come to some understanding?\\n\\nCHORUS. Confer with you, the people\\'s foe! with you, a royalist, the\\naccomplice of Brasidas![61] with you, who wear woollen fringes on your\\ncloak and let your beard grow!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Ah! it were better to separate altogether from my father than\\nto steer my boat daily through such stormy seas!\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! you have but reached the parsley and the rue, to use the\\ncommon saying.[62] What you are suffering is nothing! but welcome the\\nhour when the advocate shall adduce all these same arguments against you\\nand shall summon your accomplices to give witness.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. In the name of the gods! withdraw or we shall fight you the\\nwhole day long.\\n\\nCHORUS. No, not as long as I retain an atom of breath. Ha! your desire is\\nto tyrannize over us!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Everything is now tyranny with us, no matter what is\\nconcerned, whether it be large or small. Tyranny! I have not heard the\\nword mentioned once in fifty years, and now it is more common than\\nsalt-fish, the word is even current on the market. If you are buying\\ngurnards and don\\'t want anchovies, the huckster next door, who is selling\\nthe latter, at once exclaims, \"That is a man, whose kitchen savours of\\ntyranny!\" If you ask for onions to season your fish, the green-stuff\\nwoman winks one eye and asks, \"Ha! you ask for onions! are you seeking to\\ntyrannize, or do you think that Athens must pay you your seasonings as a\\ntribute?\"\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Yesterday I went to see a gay girl about noon and suggested she\\nshould mount and ride me; she flew into a rage, pretending I wanted to\\nrestore the tyranny of Hippias.[63]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. That\\'s the talk that pleases the people! As for myself, I\\nwant my father to lead a joyous life like Morychus[64] instead of going\\naway before dawn to basely calumniate and condemn; and for this I am\\naccused of conspiracy and tyrannical practice!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. And quite right too, by Zeus! The most exquisite dishes do\\nnot make up to me for the life of which you deprive me. I scorn your red\\nmullet and your eels, and would far rather eat a nice little law suitlet\\ncooked in the pot.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. \\'Tis because you have got used to seeking your pleasure in\\nit; but if you will agree to keep silence and hear me, I think I could\\npersuade you that you deceive yourself altogether.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. _I_ deceive myself, when I am judging?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. You do not see that you are the laughing-stock of these men,\\nwhom you are ready to worship. You are their slave and do not know it.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. _I_ a slave, I, who lord it over all!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Not at all, you think you are ruling when you are only\\nobeying. Tell me, father, what do you get out of the tribute paid by so\\nmany Greek towns?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Much, and I appoint my colleagues jurymen.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. And I also. Release him, all of you, and bring me a sword. If\\nmy arguments do not prevail I will fall upon this blade. As for you, tell\\nme whether you accept the verdict of the Court.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. May I never drink my Heliast\\'s pay in honour of the good\\nGenius, if I do not.\\n\\nCHORUS. Tis now we have to draw upon our arsenal for some fresh weapon;\\nabove all do not side with this youth in his opinions. You see how\\nserious the question has become; \\'twill be all over with us, which the\\ngods forfend, if he should prevail.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Let someone bring me my tablets with all speed!\\n\\nCHORUS. Your tablets? Ha, ha! what an importance you would fain assume!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. I merely wish to note down my father\\'s points.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But what will you say of it, if he should triumph in the\\ndebate?\\n\\nCHORUS. That old men are no longer good for anything; we shall be\\nperpetually laughed at in the streets, shall be called thallophores,[65]\\nmere brief-bags. You are to be the champion of all our rights and\\nsovereignty. Come, take courage! Bring into action all the resources of\\nyour wit.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. At the outset I will prove to you that there exists no king\\nwhose might is greater than ours. Is there a pleasure, a blessing\\ncomparable with that of a juryman? Is there a being who lives more in the\\nmidst of delights, who is more feared, aged though he be? From the moment\\nI leave my bed, men of power, the most illustrious in the city, await me\\nat the bar of the tribunal; the moment I am seen from the greatest\\ndistance, they come forward to offer me a gentle hand,--that has pilfered\\nthe public funds; they entreat me, bowing right low and with a piteous\\nvoice, \"Oh! father,\" they say, \"pity me, I adjure you by the profit _you_\\nwere able to make in the public service or in the army, when dealing with\\nthe victuals.\" Why, the man who thus speaks would not know of my\\nexistence, had I not let him off on some former occasion.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Let us note this first point, the supplicants.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. These entreaties have appeased my wrath, and I enter--firmly\\nresolved to do nothing that I have promised. Nevertheless I listen to the\\naccused. Oh! what tricks to secure acquittal! Ah! there is no form of\\nflattery that is not addressed to the heliast! Some groan over their\\npoverty and they exaggerate the truth in order to make their troubles\\nequal to my own. Others tell us anecdotes or some comic story from Aesop.\\nOthers, again, cut jokes; they fancy I shall be appeased if I laugh. If\\nwe are not even then won over, why, then they drag forward their young\\nchildren by the hand, both boys and girls, who prostrate themselves and\\nwhine with one accord, and then the father, trembling as if before a god,\\nbeseeches me not to condemn him out of pity for them, \"If you love the\\nvoice of the lamb, have pity on my son\\'s\"; and because I am fond of\\nlittle sows,[66] I must yield to his daughter\\'s prayers. Then we relax\\nthe heat of our wrath a little for him. Is not this great power indeed,\\nwhich allows even wealth to be disdained?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. A second point to note, the disdain of wealth. And now recall\\nto me what are the advantages you enjoy, you, who pretend to rule over\\nGreece?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Being entrusted with the inspection of the young men, we have\\na right to examine their organs. Is Aeagrus[67] accused, he is not\\nacquitted before he has recited a passage from \\'Niobe\\'[68] and he chooses\\nthe finest. If a flute-player gains his case, he adjusts his\\nmouth-strap[69] in return and plays us the final air while we are\\nleaving. A father on his death-bed names some husband for his daughter,\\nwho is his sole heir; but we care little for his will or for the shell so\\nsolemnly placed over the seal;[70] we give the young maiden to him who\\nhas best known how to secure our favour. Name me another duty that is so\\nimportant and so irresponsible.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Aye, \\'tis a fine privilege, and the only one on which I can\\ncongratulate you; but surely to violate the will is to act badly towards\\nthe heiress.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. And if the Senate and the people have trouble in deciding\\nsome important case, it is decreed to send the culprits before the\\nheliasts; then Euathlus[71] and the illustrious Colaconymus,[72] who cast\\naway his shield, swear not to betray us and to fight for the people. Did\\never an orator carry the day with his opinion if he had not first\\ndeclared that the jury should be dismissed for the day as soon as they\\nhad given their first verdict? We are the only ones whom Cleon, the great\\nbawler, does not badger. On the contrary, he protects and caresses us; he\\nkeeps off the flies, which is what you have never done for your father.\\nTheorus, who is a man not less illustrious than Euphemius,[73] takes the\\nsponge out of the pot and blacks our shoes. See then what good things you\\ndeprive and despoil me of. Pray, is this obeying or being a slave, as you\\npretended to be able to prove?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Talk away to your heart\\'s content; you must come to a stop at\\nlast and then you shall see that this grand power only resembles one of\\nthose things that, wash \\'em as you will, remain as foul as ever.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But I am forgetting the most pleasing thing of all. When I\\nreturn home with my pay, everyone runs to greet me because of my money.\\nFirst my daughter bathes me, anoints my feet, stoops to kiss me and,\\nwhile she is calling me \"her dearest father,\" fishes out my triobolus\\nwith her tongue;[74] then my little wife comes to wheedle me and brings a\\nnice light cake; she sits beside me and entreats me in a thousand ways,\\n\"Do take this now; do have some more.\" All this delights me hugely, and I\\nhave no need to turn towards you or the steward to know when it shall\\nplease him to serve my dinner, all the while cursing and grumbling. But\\nif he does not quickly knead my cake, I have this,[75] which is my\\ndefence, my shield against all ills. If you do not pour me out drink, I\\nhave brought this long-eared jar[76] full of wine. How it brays, when I\\nbend back and bury its neck in my mouth! What terrible and noisy\\ngurglings, and how I laugh at your wine-skins. As to power, am I not\\nequal to the king of the gods? If our assembly is noisy, all say as they\\npass, \"Great gods! the tribunal is rolling out its thunder!\" If I let\\nloose the lightning, the richest, aye, the noblest are half dead with\\nfright and shit themselves with terror. You yourself are afraid of me,\\nyea, by Demeter! you are afraid.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. May I die if you frighten me.\\n\\nCHORUS. Never have I heard speech so elegant or so sensible.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah! he thought he had only to turn me round his finger; he\\nshould, however, have known the vigour of my eloquence.\\n\\nCHORUS. He has said everything without omission. I felt myself grow\\ntaller while I listened to him. Methought myself meting out justice in\\nthe Islands of the Blest, so much was I taken with the charm of his\\nwords.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. How overjoyed they are! What extravagant delight! Ah! ah! you\\nare going to get a thrashing to-day.\\n\\nCHORUS. Come, plot everything you can to beat him; \\'tis not easy to\\nsoften me if you do not talk on my side, and if you have nothing but\\nnonsense to spout, \\'tis time to buy a good millstone, freshly cut withal,\\nto crush my anger.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. The cure of a disease, so inveterate and so widespread in\\nAthens, is a difficult task and of too great importance for the scope of\\nComedy. Nevertheless, my old father....\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Cease to call me by that name, for, if you do not prove me a\\nslave and that quickly too, you must die by my hand, even if I must be\\ndeprived of my share in the sacred feasts.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Listen to me, dear little father, unruffle that frowning brow\\nand reckon, you can do so without trouble, not with pebbles, but on your\\nfingers, what is the sum-total of the tribute paid by the allied towns;\\nbesides this we have the direct imposts, a mass of percentage dues, the\\nfees of the courts of justice, the produce from the mines, the markets,\\nthe harbours, the public lands and the confiscations. All these together\\namount to close on two thousand talents. Take from this sum the annual\\npay of the dicasts; they number six thousand, and there have never been\\nmore in this town; so therefore it is one hundred and fifty talents that\\ncome to you.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. What! our pay is not even a tithe of the State revenue?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Why no, certainly not.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. And where does the rest go then?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. To those who say: \"I shall never betray the interests of the\\nmasses; I shall always fight for the people.\" And \\'tis you, father, who\\nlet yourself be caught with their fine talk, who give them all power over\\nyourself. They are the men who extort fifty talents at a time by threat\\nand intimidation from the allies. \"Pay tribute to me,\" they say, \"or I\\nshall loose the lightning on your town and destroy it.\" And you, you are\\ncontent to gnaw the crumbs of your own might. What do the allies do? They\\nsee that the Athenian mob lives on the tribunal in niggard and miserable\\nfashion, and they count you for nothing, for not more than the vote of\\nConnus;[77] \\'tis on those wretches that they lavish everything, dishes of\\nsalt fish, wine, tapestries, cheese, honey, sesame-fruit, cushions,\\nflagons, rich clothing, chaplets, necklets, drinking-cups, all that\\nyields pleasure and health. And you, their master, to you as a reward for\\nall your toil both on land and sea, nothing is given, not even a clove of\\ngarlic to eat with your little fish.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. No, undoubtedly not; I have had to send and buy some from\\nEucharides. But you told me I was a slave. Prove it then, for I am dying\\nwith impatience.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Is it not the worst of all slaveries to see all these\\nwretches and their flatterers, whom they gorge with gold, at the head of\\naffairs? As for you, you are content with the three obols they give you\\nand which you have so painfully earned in the galleys, in battles and\\nsieges. But what I stomach least is that you go to sit on the tribunal by\\norder. Some lewd stripling, the son of Chereas, to wit, enters your house\\nbalancing his body, rotten with debauchery, on his straddling legs and\\ncharges you to come and judge at daybreak, and precisely to the minute.\\n\"He who only presents himself after the opening of the Court,\" says he,\\n\"will not get the triobolus.\" But he himself, though he arrives late,\\nwill nevertheless get his drachma as a public advocate. If an accused man\\nmakes him some present, he shares it with a colleague and the pair agree\\nto arrange the matter like two sawyers, one of whom pulls and the other\\npushes. As for you, you have only eyes for the public pay-clerk, and you\\nsee nothing.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Can it be I am treated thus? Oh! what is it you are saying?\\nYou stir me to the bottom of my heart! I am all ears! I cannot syllable\\nwhat I feel.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Consider then; you might be rich, both you and all the\\nothers; I know not why you let yourself be fooled by these folk who call\\nthemselves the people\\'s friends. A myriad of towns obey you, from the\\nEuxine to Sardis. What do you gain thereby? Nothing but this miserable\\npay, and even that is like the oil with which the flock of wool is\\nimpregnated and is doled to you drop by drop, just enough to keep you\\nfrom dying of hunger. They want you to be poor, and I will tell you why.\\n\\'Tis so that you may know only those who nourish you, and so that, if it\\npleases them to loose you against one of their foes, you shall leap upon\\nhim with fury. If they wished to assure the well-being of the people,\\nnothing would be easier for them. We have now a thousand towns that pay\\nus tribute; let them command each of these to feed twenty Athenians; then\\ntwenty thousand of our citizens would be eating nothing but hare, would\\ndrink nothing but the purest of milk, and always crowned with garlands,\\nwould be enjoying the delights to which the great name of their country\\nand the trophies of Marathon give them the right; whereas to-day you are\\nlike the hired labourers who gather the olives; you follow him who pays\\nyou.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Alas! my hand is benumbed; I can no longer draw my sword.[78]\\nWhat has become of my strength?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. When they are afraid, they promise to divide Euboea[79] among\\nyou and to give each fifty bushels of wheat, but what have they given\\nyou? Nothing excepting, quite recently, five bushels of barley, and even\\nthese you have only obtained with great difficulty, on proving you were\\nnot aliens, and then choenix by choenix.[80] That is why I always kept\\nyou shut in; I wanted you to be fed by me and no longer at the beck of\\nthese blustering braggarts. Even now I am ready to let you have all you\\nwant, provided you no longer let yourself be suckled by the pay-clerk.\\n\\nCHORUS. He was right who said, \"Decide nothing till you have heard both\\nsides,\" for it seems to me, that \\'tis you who now gain the complete\\nvictory. My wrath is appeased, I throw away my sticks. Come, comrade, our\\ncontemporary, let yourself be gained over by his words; come, do not be\\ntoo obstinate or too perverse. Why have I no relation, no ally to speak\\nto me like this? Do not doubt it, \\'tis a god who is now protecting you\\nand loading you with his benefits. Accept them.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. I will feed him, I will give him everything that is suitable\\nfor an old man, oatmeal gruel, a cloak, soft furs and a maid to rub his\\nloins and play with his tool. But he is silent and utters not a word;\\n\\'tis a bad sign.\\n\\nCHORUS. He has thought the thing over and has recognized his folly; he\\nreproaches himself for not having followed your advice always. But there\\nhe is, converted by your words, and has no doubt become wiser to alter\\nhis ways in future and to believe in none but you.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Alas! alas!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Now why this lamentation?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. A truce to your promises! What I love is down there, \\'tis\\ndown there I want to be, there, where the herald cries, \"Who has not yet\\nvoted? Let him rise!\" I want to be the last to leave the urn of all. Oh,\\nmy soul, my soul! where art thou? come! oh! dark shadows, make way for\\nme![81] By Heracles, may I reach the Court in time to convict Cleon of\\ntheft.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Come, father, in the name of the gods, believe me!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Believe you! Ask me anything, anything, except one.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. What is it? Let us hear.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Not to judge any more! Before I consent, I shall have\\nappeared before Pluto.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Very well then, since you find so much pleasure in it, go\\ndown there no more, but stay here and deal out justice to your slaves.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But what is there to judge? Are you mad?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Everything as in a tribunal. If a servant opens a door\\nsecretly, you inflict upon him a simple fine; \\'tis what you have\\nrepeatedly done down there. Everything can be arranged to suit you. If it\\nis warm in the morning, you can judge in the sunlight; if it is snowing,\\nthen seated at your fire; if it rains, you go indoors; and if you only\\nrise at noon, there will be no Thesmothetes[82] to exclude you from the\\nprecincts.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. The notion pleases me.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Moreover, if a pleader is long-winded, you will not be\\nfasting and chafing and seeking vengeance on the accused.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But could I judge as well with my mouth full?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Much better. Is it not said, that the dicasts, when deceived\\nby lying witnesses, have need to ruminate well in order to arrive at the\\ntruth?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Well said, but you have not told me yet who will pay salary.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. I will.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. So much the better; in this way I shall be paid by myself.\\nBecause that cursed jester, Lysistratus,[83] played me an infamous trick\\nthe other day. He received a drachma for the two of us[84] and went on\\nthe fish-market to get it changed and then brought me back three mullet\\nscales. I took them for obols and crammed them into my mouth;[85] but the\\nsmell choked me and I quickly spat them out. So I dragged him before the\\nCourt.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. And what did he say to that?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Well, he pretended I had the stomach of a cock. \"You have\\nsoon digested the money,\" he said with a laugh.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. You see, that is yet another advantage.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. And no small one either. Come, do as you will.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Wait! I will bring everything here.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. You see, the oracles are coming true; I have heard it\\nforetold, that one day the Athenians would dispense justice in their own\\nhouses, that each citizen would have himself a little tribunal\\nconstructed in his porch similar to the altars of Hecaté,[86] and that\\nthere would be such before every door.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Hold! what do you say? I have brought you everything needful\\nand much more into the bargain. See, here is an _article,_ should you\\nwant to piss; it shall be hung beside you on a nail.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Good idea! Right useful at my age. You have found the true\\npreventive of bladder troubles.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Here is fire, and near to it are lentils, should you want to\\ntake a snack.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. \\'Tis admirably arranged. For thus, even when feverish, I\\nshall nevertheless receive my pay; and besides, I could eat my lentils\\nwithout quitting my seat. But why this cock?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. So that, should you doze during some pleading, he may awaken\\nyou by crowing up there.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I want only for one thing more; all the rest is as good as\\ncan be.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. What is that?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. If only they could bring me an image of the hero Lycus.[87]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Here it is! Why, you might think it was the god himself!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh! hero, my master! how repulsive you are to look at! \\'Tis\\nan exact portrait of Cleonymus!\\n\\nSOSIAS. That is why, hero though he be, he has no weapon.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. The sooner you take your seat, the sooner I shall call a\\ncase.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Call it, for I have been seated ever so long.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Let us see. What case shall we bring up first? Is there a\\nslave who has done something wrong? Ah! you Thracian there, who burnt the\\nstew-pot t\\'other day.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Hold, hold! Here is a fine state of things! you had almost\\nmade me judge without a bar,[88] and that is the thing of all others most\\nsacred among us.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. By Zeus! I had forgotten it, but I will run indoors and bring\\nyou one immediately. What is this after all, though, but mere force of\\nhabit!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Plague take the brute! Can anyone keep such a dog?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Hullo! what\\'s the matter?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Why, \\'tis Labes,[89] who has just rushed into the kitchen and\\nhas seized a whole Sicilian cheese and gobbled it up.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Good! this will be the first offence I shall make my father\\ntry. (_To Xanthias._) Come along and lay your accusation.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. No, not I; the other dog vows he will be accuser, if the matter\\nis set down for trial.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Well then, bring them both along.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. I am coming.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. What is this?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. \\'Tis the pig-trough[90] of the swine dedicated to Hestia.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But it\\'s sacrilege to bring it here.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. No, no, by addressing Hestia first,[91] I might, thanks to\\nher, crush an adversary.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Put an end to delay by calling up the case. My verdict is\\nalready settled.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Wait! I must yet bring out the tablets[92] and the\\nscrolls.[93]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh! I am boiling, I am dying with impatience at your delays.\\nI could have traced the sentence in the dust.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. There you are.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Then call the case.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. I am here.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Firstly, who is this?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Ah! my god! why, this is unbearable! I have forgotten the\\nurns.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Well now! where are you off to?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. To look for the urns.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Unnecessary, I shall use these vases.[94]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Very well, then we have all we need, except the clepsydra.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Well then! and this? what is it if not a clepsydra?[95]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. True again! \\'Tis calling things by their right name! Let fire\\nbe brought quickly from the house with myrtle boughs and incense, and let\\nus invoke the gods before opening the sitting.\\n\\nCHORUS. Offer them libations and your vows and we will thank them that a\\nnoble agreement has put an end to your bickerings and strife.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. And first let there be a sacred silence.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! god of Delphi! oh! Phoebus Apollo! convert into the greatest\\nblessing for us all what is now happening before this house, and cure us\\nof our error, oh, Paean,[96] our helper!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Oh! Powerful god, Apollo Aguieus,[97] who watchest at the\\ndoor of my entrance hall, accept this fresh sacrifice; I offer it that\\nyou may deign to soften my father\\'s excessive severity; he is as hard as\\niron, his heart is like sour wine; do thou pour into it a little honey.\\nLet him become gentle like other men, let him take more interest in the\\naccused than in the accusers, may he allow himself to be softened by\\nentreaties; calm his acrid humour and deprive his irritable mind of all\\nsting.\\n\\nCHORUS. We unite our vows and chants to those of this new magistrate.[98]\\nHis words have won our favour and we are convinced that he loves the\\npeople more than any of the young men of the present day.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. If there be any judge near at hand, let him enter; once the\\nproceedings have opened, we shall admit him no more.[99]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Who is the defendant? Ha! what a sentence he will get!\\n\\nXANTHIAS (_Prosecuting Council_). Listen to the indictment. A dog of\\nCydathenea doth hereby charge Labes of Aexonia with having devoured a\\nSicilian cheese by himself without accomplices. Penalty demanded, a\\ncollar of fig-tree wood.[100]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Nay, a dog\\'s death, if convicted.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. This is Labes, the defendant.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh! what a wretched brute! how entirely he looks the rogue!\\nHe thinks to deceive me by keeping his jaws closed. Where is the\\nplaintiff, the dog of Cydathenea?\\n\\nDOG. Bow wow! bow wow!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Here he is.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Why, \\'tis a second Labes, a great barker and a licker of\\ndishes.\\n\\nSOSIAS (_Herald_). Silence! Keep your seats! (_To Xanthias._) And you, up\\non your feet and accuse him.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Go on, and I will help myself and eat these lentils.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Men of the jury, listen to this indictment I have drawn up. He\\nhas committed the blackest of crimes, both against me and the\\nseamen.[101] He sought refuge in a dark corner to glutton on a big\\nSicilian cheese, with which he sated his hunger.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Why, the crime is clear; the foul brute this very moment\\nbelched forth a horrible odour of cheese right under my nose.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And he refused to share with me. And yet can anyone style\\nhimself your benefactor, when he does not cast a morsel to your poor dog?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Then he has not shared?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Not with me, his comrade.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Then his madness is as hot as my lentils.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. In the name of the gods, father! No hurried verdict without\\nhearing the other side!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But the evidence is plain; the fact speaks for itself.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Then beware of acquitting the most selfish of canine gluttons,\\nwho has devoured the whole cheese, rind and all, prowling round the\\nplatter.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. There is not even enough left for me to fill up the chinks in\\nmy pitcher.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Besides, you _must_ punish him, because the same house cannot\\nkeep two thieves. Let me not have barked in vain, else I shall never bark\\nagain.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh! the black deeds he has just denounced! What a shameless\\nthief! Say, cock, is not that your opinion too? Ha, ha! He thinks as I\\ndo. Here, Thesmothetes![102] where are you? Hand me the vessel.\\n\\nSOSIAS (_Thesmothetes_). Take it yourself. I go to call the witnesses;\\nthese are a plate, a pestle, a cheese knife, a brazier, a stew-pot and\\nother half-burnt utensils. (_To Philocleon._) But you have not finished?\\nyou are piddling away still! Have done and be seated.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ha, ha! I reckon I know somebody who will shit himself with\\nfright today.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Will you never cease showing yourself hard and intractable,\\nand especially to the accused? You tear them to pieces tooth and nail.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Come forward and defend yourself. What means this silence?\\nAnswer.\\n\\nSOSIAS. No doubt he has nothing to say.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Not so, but I think he has got what happened once to\\nThucydides, when accused;[103] his jaws suddenly set fast. Get away! I\\nwill undertake your defence.--Gentlemen of the jury, \\'tis a difficult\\nthing to speak for a dog who has been calumniated, but nevertheless I\\nwill try. \\'Tis a good dog, and he chivies the wolves finely.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. He! that thief and conspirator!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. But \\'tis the best of all our dogs; he is capable of guarding\\na whole flock.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. And what good is that, if he eats the cheese?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. What? he fights for you, he guards your door; \\'tis an\\nexcellent dog in every respect. Forgive him his larceny; he is wretchedly\\nignorant, he cannot play the lyre.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I wish he did not know how to write either; then the rascal\\nwould not have drawn up his pleadings.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Witnesses, I pray you, listen. Come forward, grafting-knife,\\nand speak up; answer me clearly. You were paymaster at the time. Did you\\ngrate out to the soldiers what was given you?--He says he did so.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But, by Zeus! he lies.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Oh! have patience. Take pity on the unfortunate. Labes feeds\\nonly on fish-bones and fishes\\' heads and has not an instant of peace. The\\nother is good only to guard the house; he never moves from here, but\\ndemands his share of all that is brought in and bites those who refuse.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh! Heaven! have I fallen ill? I feel my anger cooling! Woe\\nto me! I am softening!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Have pity, father, pity, I adjure you; you would not have him\\ndead. Where are his puppies? Come, poor little beasties, yap, up on your\\nhaunches, beg and whine!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Descend, descend, descend, descend![104]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. I will descend, although that word, \"descend,\" has too often\\nraised false hope. None the less, I will descend.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Plague seize it! Have I then done wrong to eat! What! I to be\\ncrying! Ah! I certainly should not be weeping, if I were not blown out\\nwith lentils.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Then he is acquitted?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I did not say so.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Ah! my dear father, be good! be humane! Take this voting\\npebble and rush with your eyes closed to that second urn[105] and,\\nfather, acquit him.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. No, I know no more how to acquit than to play the lyre.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Come quickly, I will show you the way.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Is this the first urn?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Yes.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Then I have voted.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON (_aside_). I have fooled him and he has acquitted in spite of\\nhimself.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Come, I will turn out the urns. What is the result?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. We shall see.--Labes, you stand acquitted.--Eh! father,\\nwhat\\'s the matter, what is it?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah me! ah me! water! water!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Pull yourself together, sir!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Tell me! Is he really acquitted?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Yes, certainly.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Then it\\'s all over with me!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Courage, dear father, don\\'t let this afflict you so terribly.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. And so I have charged my conscience with the acquittal of an\\naccused being! What will become of me? Sacred gods! forgive me. I did it\\ndespite myself; it is not in my character.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Do not vex yourself, father; I will feed you well, will take\\nyou everywhere to eat and drink with me; you shall go to every feast;\\nhenceforth your life shall be nothing but pleasure, and Hyperbolus shall\\nno longer have you for a tool. But come, let us go in.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. So be it; if you will, let us go in.\\n\\nCHORUS (_Parabasis_). Go where it pleases you and may your happiness be\\ngreat. You meanwhile, oh! countless myriads, listen to the sound counsels\\nI am going to give you and take care they are not lost upon you. \\'Twould\\nbe the fate of vulgar spectators, not that of such an audience. Hence,\\npeople, lend me your ear, if you love frank speaking. The poet has a\\nreproach to make against his audience; he says you have ill-treated him\\nin return for the many services he has rendered you. At first he kept\\nhimself in the background and lent help secretly to other poets,[106] and\\nlike the prophetic Genius, who hid himself in the belly of Eurycles,[107]\\nslipped within the spirit of another and whispered to him many a comic\\nhit. Later he ran the risks of the theatre on his own account, with his\\nface uncovered, and dared to guide his Muse unaided. Though overladen\\nwith success and honours more than any of your poets, indeed despite all\\nhis glory, he does not yet believe he has attained his goal; his heart is\\nnot swollen with pride and he does not seek to seduce the young folk in\\nthe wrestling school.[108] If any lover runs up to him to complain\\nbecause he is furious at seeing the object of his passion derided on the\\nstage, he takes no heed of such reproaches, for he is only inspired with\\nhonest motives and his Muse is no go-between. From the very outset of his\\ndramatic career he has disdained to assail those who were men, but with a\\ncourage worthy of Heracles himself he attacked the most formidable\\nmonsters, and at the beginning went straight for that beast[109] with the\\nsharp teeth, with the terrible eyes that flashed lambent fire like those\\nof Cynna,[110] surrounded by a hundred lewd flatterers who spittle-licked\\nhim to his heart\\'s content; it had a voice like a roaring torrent, the\\nstench of a seal, a foul Lamia\\'s testicles,[111] and the rump of a camel.\\nOur poet did not tremble at the sight of this horrible monster, nor did\\nhe dream of gaining him over; and again this very day he is fighting for\\nyour good. Last year besides, he attacked those pale, shivering and\\nfeverish beings[112] who strangled your fathers in the dark, throttled\\nyour grandfathers,[113] and who, lying in the beds of the most\\ninoffensive, piled up against them lawsuits, summonses and witnesses to\\nsuch an extent, that many of them flew in terror to the Polemarch for\\nrefuge.[114] Such is the champion you have found to purify your country\\nof all its evil, and last year you betrayed him,[115] when he sowed the\\nmost novel ideas, which, however, did not strike root, because you did\\nnot understand their value; notwithstanding this, he swears by Bacchus,\\nthe while offering him libations, that none ever heard better comic\\nverses. \\'Tis a disgrace to you not to have caught their drift at once; as\\nfor the poet, he is none the less appreciated by the enlightened judges.\\nHe shivered his oars in rushing boldly forward to board his foe.[116] But\\nin future, my dear fellow-citizens, love and honour more those of your\\npoets who seek to imagine and express some new thought. Make their ideas\\nyour own, keep them in your caskets like sweet-scented fruit.[117] If you\\ndo, your clothing will emit an odour of wisdom the whole year through.\\n\\nFormerly we were untiring, especially in _other_ exercises,[118] but \\'tis\\nover now; our brow is crowned with hair whiter than the swan. We must,\\nhowever, rekindle a youthful ardour in these remnants of what was, and\\nfor myself, I prefer my old age to the curly hair and the finery of all\\nthese lewd striplings.\\n\\nShould any among you spectators look upon me with wonder, because of this\\nwasp waist, or not know the meaning of this sting, I will soon dispel his\\nignorance. We, who wear this appendage, are the true Attic men, who alone\\nare noble and native to the soil, the bravest of all people. \\'Tis we who,\\nweapon in hand, have done so much for the country, when the Barbarian\\nshed torrents of fire and smoke over our city in his relentless desire to\\nseize our nests by force. At once we ran up, armed with lance and\\nbuckler, and, drunk with the bitter wine of anger, we gave them battle,\\nman standing to man and rage distorting our lips.[119] A hail of arrows\\nhid the sky. However, by the help of the gods, we drove off the foe\\ntowards evening. Before the battle an owl had flown over our army.[120]\\nThen we pursued them with our lance point in their loins as one hunts the\\ntunny-fish; they fled and we stung them in the jaw and in the eyes, so\\nthat even now the barbarians tell each other that there is nothing in the\\nworld more to be feared than the Attic wasp.\\n\\nOh! at that time I was terrible, I feared nothing; forth on my galleys I\\nwent in search of my foe and subjected him.[121] Then we never thought of\\nrounding fine phrases, we never dreamt of calumny; \\'twas who should prove\\nthe strongest rower. And thus we took many a town from the Medes,[122]\\nand \\'tis to us that Athens owes the tributes that our young men thieve\\nto-day.\\n\\nLook well at us, and you will see that we have all the character and\\nhabits of the wasp. Firstly, if roused, no beings are more irascible,\\nmore relentless than we are. In all other things, too, we act like wasps.\\nWe collect in swarms, in a kind of nests,[123] and some go a-judging with\\nthe Archon,[124] some with the Eleven,[125] others at the Odeon;[126]\\nthere are yet others, who hardly move at all, like the grubs in the\\ncells, but remain glued to the walls[127] and bent double to the ground.\\nWe also pay full attention to the discovery of all sorts of means of\\nexisting and sting the first who comes, so as to live at his expense.\\nFinally, we have among us drones,[128] who have no sting and who, without\\ngiving themselves the least trouble, seize on our revenues as they flow\\npast them and devour them. \\'Tis this that grieves us most of all, to see\\nmen who have never served or held either lance or oar in defence of their\\ncountry, enriching themselves at our expense without ever raising a\\nblister on their hands. In short, I give it as my deliberate opinion that\\nin future every citizen not possessed of a sting shall not receive the\\ntriobolus.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. As long as I live, I will never give up this cloak; \\'tis the\\none I wore in that battle[129] when Boreas delivered us from such fierce\\nattacks,\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. You do not know what is good for you.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah! I know not how to use fine clothing! T\\'other day, when\\ncramming myself with fried fish, I dropped so many grease spots that I\\nhad to pay three obols to the cleaner.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. At least have a try, since you have once for all handed the\\ncare for your well-being over to me.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Very well then! what must I do?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Take off your cloak, and put on this tunic in its stead.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. \\'Twas well worth while to beget and bring up children, so\\nthat this one should now wish to choke me.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Come, take this tunic and put it on without so much talk.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Great gods! what sort of a cursed garment is this?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Some call it a pelisse, others a Persian cloak.[130]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah! I thought it was a wraprascal like those made at\\nThymaetia.[131]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Pray, how should you know such garments? \\'Tis only at Sardis\\nyou could have seen them, and you have never been there.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I\\' faith, no! but it seems to me exactly like the mantle\\nMorychus[132] sports.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Not at all; I tell you they are woven at Ecbatana.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. What! are there woollen ox-guts[133] then at Ecbatana?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Whatever are you talking about? These are woven by the\\nBarbarians at great cost. I am certain this pelisse has consumed more\\nthan a talent of wool.[134]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. It should be called wool-waster then instead of pelisse.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Come, father, just hold still for a moment and put it on.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh! horrors! what a waft of heat the hussy wafts up my nose!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Will you have done with this fooling?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. No, by Zeus! if need be, I prefer you should put me in the\\noven.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Come! I will put it round you. There!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. At all events, bring out a crook.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Why, whatever for?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. To drag me out of it before I am quite melted.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Now take off those wretched clogs and put on these nice\\nLaconian slippers.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I put on odious slippers made by our foes! Never!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Come! put your foot in and push hard. Quick!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. \\'Tis ill done of you. You want me to put my foot on Laconian\\nground.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Now the other.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah! no, not that one; one of its toes holds the Laconians in\\nhorror.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Positively you must.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Alas! alas! Then I shall have no chilblains in my old\\nage.[135]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Now, hurry up and get them on; and now imitate the easy\\neffeminate gait of the rich. See, like this.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. There!... Look at my get-up and tell me which rich man I most\\nresemble in my walk.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Why, you look like a garlic plaster on a boil.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah! I am longing to swagger and sway my rump about.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Now, will you know how to talk gravely with well-informed men\\nof good class?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Undoubtedly.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. What will you say to them?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh, lots of things. First of all I shall say, that\\nLamia,[136] seeing herself caught, let fly a fart; then, that Cardopion\\nand her mother....\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Come, no fabulous tales, pray! talk of realities, of domestic\\nfacts, as is usually done.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah! I know something that is indeed most domestic. Once upon\\na time there was a rat and a cat....\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. \"Oh, you ignorant fool,\" as Theagenes said[137] to the\\nscavenger in a rage. Are you going to talk of cats and rats among\\nhigh-class people?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Then what should I talk about?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Tell some dignified story. Relate how you were sent on a\\nsolemn mission with Androcles and Clisthenes.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. On a mission! never in my life, except once to Paros,[138] a\\njob which brought me in two obols a day.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. At least say, that you have just seen Ephudion making good\\nplay in the pancratium[139] with Ascondas and, that despite his age and\\nhis white hair, he is still robust in loin and arm and flank and that his\\nchest is a very breastplate.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Stop! stop! what nonsense! Who ever contested at the\\npancratium with a breast-plate on?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. That is how well-behaved folk like to talk. But another\\nthing. When at wine, it would be fitting to relate some good story of\\nyour youthful days. What is your most brilliant feat?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. My best feat? Ah! \\'twas when I stole Ergasion\\'s vine-props.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. You and your vine-props! you\\'ll be the death of me! Tell of\\none of your boar-hunts or of when you coursed the hare. Talk about some\\ntorch-race you were in; tell of some deed of daring.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah! my most daring deed was when, quite a young man still, I\\nprosecuted Phayllus, the runner, for defamation, and he was condemned by\\na majority of two votes.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Enough of that! Now recline there, and practise the bearing\\nthat is fitting at table in society.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. How must I recline? Tell me quick!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. In an elegant style.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Like this?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Not at all.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. How then?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Spread your knees on the tapestries and give your body the\\nmost easy curves, like those taught in the gymnasium. Then praise some\\nbronze vase, survey the ceiling, admire the awning stretched over the\\ncourt. Water is poured over our hands; the tables are spread; we sup and,\\nafter ablution, we now offer libations to the gods.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But, by Zeus! this supper is but a dream, it appears!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. The flute-player has finished the prelude. The guests are\\nTheorus, Aeschines, Phanus, Cleon, Acestor;[140] and beside this last, I\\ndon\\'t know who else. You are with them. Shall you know exactly how to\\ntake up the songs that are started?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Better than any born mountaineer of Attica.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. That we shall see. Suppose me to be Cleon. I am the first to\\nbegin the song of Harmodius, and you take it up: \"There never was yet\\nseen in Athens ...\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. ... such a rogue or such a thief.\"[141]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Why, you wretched man, \\'twill be the end of you if you sing\\nthat. He will vow your ruin, your destruction, to chase you out of the\\ncountry.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Well! then I shall answer his threats with another song:\\n\"With your madness for supreme power, you will end by overthrowing the\\ncity, which even now totters towards ruin.\"\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. And when Theorus, prone at Cleon\\'s feet, takes his hand and\\nsings, \"Like Admetus, love those who are brave,\"[142] what reply will you\\nmake him?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I shall sing, \"I know not how to play the fox, nor call\\nmyself the friend of both parties.\"\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Then comes the turn of Aeschines, the son of Sellus, and a\\nwell-trained and clever musician, who will sing, \"Good things and riches\\nfor Clitagoras and me and eke for the Thessalians!\"\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. \"The two of us have squandered a deal between us.\"\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. At this game you seem at home. But come, we will go and dine\\nwith Philoctemon.--Slave! slave! place our dinner in a basket, and let us\\ngo for a good long drinking bout.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. By no means, it is too dangerous; for after drinking, one\\nbreaks in doors, one comes to blows, one batters everything. Anon, when\\nthe wine is slept off, one is forced to pay.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Not if you are with decent people. Either they undertake to\\nappease the offended person or, better still, you say something witty,\\nyou tell some comic story, perhaps one of those you have yourself heard\\nat table, either in Aesop\\'s style or in that of Sybaris; all laugh and\\nthe trouble is ended.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Faith! \\'tis worth while learning many stories then, if you\\nare thus not punished for the ill you do. But come, no more delay!\\n\\nCHORUS. More than once have I given proof of cunning and never of\\nstupidity, but how much more clever is Amynias, the son of Sellus and of\\nthe race of forelock-wearers; him we saw one day coming to dine with\\nLeogaras,[143] bringing as his share one apple and a pomegranate, and\\nbear in mind he was as hungry as Antiphon.[144] He went on an embassy to\\nPharsalus,[145] and there he lived solely among the Thessalian\\nmercenaries;[146] indeed, is he not the vilest of mercenaries himself?\\n\\nOh! blessed, oh! fortunate Automenes, how enviable is your fortune! You\\nhave three sons, the most industrious in the world; one is the friend of\\nall, a very able man, the first among the lyre-players, the favourite of\\nthe Graces. The second is an actor, and his talent is beyond all praise.\\nAs for Ariphrades, he is by far the most gifted; his father would swear\\nto me, that without any master whatever and solely through the\\nspontaneous effort of his happy nature, he taught himself the use of his\\ntongue in the lewd places[147] where he spends the whole of his time.\\n\\nSome have said that I and Cleon were reconciled. This is the truth of the\\nmatter: Cleon was harassing me, persecuting and belabouring me in every\\nway; and, when I was being fleeced, the public laughed at seeing me\\nuttering such loud cries; not that they cared about me, but simply\\ncurious to know whether, when trodden down by my enemy, I would not hurl\\nat him some taunt. Noticing this, I have played the wheedler a bit; but\\nnow, look! the prop is deceiving the vine![148]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh! tortoises! happy to have so hard a skin, thrice happy to\\ncarry this roof that protects your backs! Oh! creatures full of sense!\\nwhat a happy thought to cover your bodies with this shell, which shields\\nit from blows! As for me, I can no longer move; the stick has so\\nbelaboured my body.\\n\\nCHORUS. Eh, what\\'s the matter, child? for, old as he may be, one has the\\nright to call anyone a child who has let himself be beaten.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Alas! my master is really the worst of all plagues. He was the\\nmost drunk of all the guests, and yet among them were Hippyllus,\\nAntiphon, Lycon, Lysistratus, Theophrastus and Phrynichus. But he was a\\nhundred times more insolent than any. As soon as he had stuffed himself\\nwith a host of good dishes, he began to leap and spring, to laugh and to\\nlet wind like a little ass well blown out with barley. Then he set to\\na-beating me with all his heart, shouting, \"Slave! slave!\" Lysistratus,\\nas soon as he saw him, let fly this comparison at him. \"Old fellow,\" said\\nhe, \"you resemble one of the scum assuming the airs of a rich man or a\\nstupid ass that has broken loose from its stable.\" \"As for you,\" bawled\\nthe other at the top of his voice, \"you are like a grasshopper,[149]\\nwhose cloak is worn to the thread, or like Sthenelus[150] after his\\nclothes had been sold.\" All applauded excepting Theophrastus, who made a\\ngrimace as behoved a well-bred man like him. The old man called to him,\\n\"Hi! tell me then what you have to be proud of? Not so much mouthing,\\nyou, who so well know how to play the buffoon and to lick-spittle the\\nrich!\" \\'Twas thus he insulted each in turn with the grossest of jests,\\nand he reeled off a thousand of the most absurd and ridiculous speeches.\\nAt last, when he was thoroughly drunk, he started towards here, striking\\neveryone he met. Hold, here he comes reeling along. I will be off for\\nfear of his blows.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON.[151] Halt! and let everyone begone, or I shall do an evil\\nturn to some of those who insist on following me. Clear off, rascals, or\\nI shall roast you with this torch!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. We shall all make you smart to-morrow for your youthful\\npranks. We shall come in a body to summon you to justice.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ho! ho! summon me! what old women\\'s babble! Know that I can\\nno longer bear to hear even the name of suits. Ha! ha! ha! this is what\\npleases _me_, \"Down with the urns!\" Won\\'t you begone? Down with the\\ndicasts! away with them, away with them! (_To the flute-girl._) Mount up\\nthere, my little gilded cock-chafer; seize hold of this rope\\'s end in\\nyour hand.[152] Hold it tight, but have a care; the rope\\'s a bit old and\\nworn, but it loves a nice rubbing still. Do you see how opportunely I got\\nyou away from the solicitations of those fellows, who wanted to make you\\nwork their tools in your mouth? You therefore owe me this return to\\ngratify mine by masturbating it. But will you pay the debt? Oh! I know\\nwell you will not even try; you will play with me, you will laugh\\nheartily at my poor old weapon as you have done at many another man\\'s.\\nAnd yet, if you would not be a naughty girl, I would redeem you, when my\\nson is dead, and you should be my concubine, my little cuntling. At\\npresent I am not my own master; I am very young and am watched very\\nclosely. My dear son never lets me out of his sight; \\'tis an unbearable\\ncreature, who would quarter a thread and skin a flint; he is afraid I\\nshould get lost, for I am his only father. But here he comes running\\ntowards us. But be quick, don\\'t stir, hold these torches. I am going to\\nplay him a young man\\'s trick, the same as he played me before I was\\ninitiated into the mysteries.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Oh! oh! you debauched old dotard! you desire and, meseems,\\nyou love pretty baggages; but, by Apollo, it shall not be with impunity!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah! you would be very glad to eat a lawsuit in vinegar, you\\nwould.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. \\'Tis a rascally trick to steal the flute-girl away from the\\nother guests.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. What flute-girl? Are you distraught, as if you had just\\nreturned from Pluto?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. By Zeus! But here is the Dardanian wench in person.[153]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Nonsense. This is a torch that I have lit in the public\\nsquare in honour of the gods.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Is this a torch?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. A torch? Certainly. Do you not see it is of several different\\ncolours?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. And what is that black part in the middle?[154]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. \\'Tis the pitch running out while it burns.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. And there, on the other side, surely that is a girl\\'s bottom?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. No. \\'Tis a small bit of the torch, that projects.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. What do you mean? what bit? Hi! you woman! come here!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Ah! ah! What do you want to do?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. To take her from you and lead her away. You are too much worn\\nout and can do nothing.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Hear me! One day, at Olympia, I saw Euphudion boxing bravely\\nagainst Ascondas;[155] he was already aged, and yet with a blow from his\\nfist he knocked down his young opponent. So beware lest I blacken _your_\\neyes.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. By Zeus! you have Olympia at your finger-ends!\\n\\nA BAKER\\'S WIFE (_to Bdelycleon_). Come to my help, I beg you, in the name\\nof the gods! This cursed man, when striking out right and left with his\\ntorch, knocked over ten loaves worth an obolus apiece, and then, to cap\\nthe deal, four others.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Do you see what lawsuits you are drawing upon yourself with\\nyour drunkenness? You will have to plead.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh, no, no! a little pretty talk and pleasant tales will soon\\nsettle the matter and reconcile her with me.\\n\\nBAKER\\'S WIFE. Not so, by the goddesses twain! It shall not be said that\\nyou have with impunity spoilt the wares of Myrtia,[156] the daughter of\\nAncylion and Sostraté.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Listen, woman, I wish to tell you a lovely anecdote.\\n\\nBAKER\\'S WIFE. Oh! friend, no anecdotes for me, thank you.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. One night Aesop was going out to supper. A drunken bitch had\\nthe impudence to bark near him. Aesop said to her, \"Oh, bitch, bitch! you\\nwould do well to sell your wicked tongue and buy some wheat.\"\\n\\nBAKER\\'S WIFE. You make a mock of me! Very well! Be you who you like, I\\nshall summons you before the market inspectors[157] for damage done to my\\nbusiness. Chaerephon[158] here shall be my witness.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. But just listen, here\\'s another will perhaps please you\\nbetter. Lasus and Simonides[159] were contesting against each other for\\nthe singing prize. Lasus said, \"Damn me if I care.\"\\n\\nBAKER\\'S WIFE. Ah! really, did he now!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. As for you, Chaerephon, _can_ you be witness to this woman,\\nwho looks as pale and tragic as Ino when she throws herself from her\\nrock[160] ... at the feet of Euripides?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Here, methinks, comes another to summons you; _he_ has his\\nwitness too. Ah! unhappy indeed we are!\\n\\nACCUSER. I summons you, old man, for outrage.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. For outrage? Oh! in the name of the gods, do not summons him!\\nI will be answerable for him; name the penalty and I will be more\\ngrateful still.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I ask for nothing better than to be reconciled with him; for\\nI admit I struck him and threw stones at him. So, first come here. Will\\nyou leave it in my hands to name the indemnity I must pay, if I promise\\nyou my friendship as well, or will you fix it yourself?\\n\\nACCUSER. Fix it; I like neither lawsuits nor disputes.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. A man of Sybaris[161] fell from his chariot and wounded his\\nhead most severely; he was a very poor driver. One of his friends came up\\nto him and said, \"Every man to his trade.\" Well then, go you to\\nPittalus[162] to get mended.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. You are incorrigible.\\n\\nACCUSER (_to his witness_). At all events, make a note of his reply.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Listen, instead of going off so abruptly. A woman at Sybaris\\nbroke a box.\\n\\nACCUSER (_to his witness_). I again ask you to witness this.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. The box therefore had the fact attested, but the woman said,\\n\"Never worry about witnessing the matter, but hurry off to buy a cord to\\ntie it together with; \\'twill be the more sensible course.\"\\n\\nACCUSER. Oh! go on with your ribaldry until the Archon calls the case.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON (_to Philocleon_). No, by Demeter! you stay here no longer! I\\ntake you and carry you off.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. And what for?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. What for? I shall carry you to the house; else there would\\nnot be enough witnesses for the accusers.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. One day at Delphi, Aesop ...\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. I don\\'t care a fig for that.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. ... was accused of having stolen a sacred vase. But he\\nreplied, that the horn beetle ... (_Philocleon goes on with his fable\\nwhile Bdelycleon is carrying him off the scene by main force._)\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Oh, dear, dear! You drive me crazy with your horn-beetle.\\n\\nCHORUS. I envy you your happiness, old man. What a contrast to his former\\nfrugal habits and his very hard life! Taught now in quite another school,\\nhe will know nothing but the pleasures of ease. Perhaps he will jib at\\nit, for indeed \\'tis difficult to renounce what has become one\\'s second\\nnature. However, many have done it, and adopting the ideas of others,\\nhave changed their use and wont. As for Philocleon\\'s son, I, like all\\nwise and judicious men, cannot sufficiently praise his filial tenderness\\nand his tact. Never have I met a more amiable nature, and I have\\nconceived the greatest fondness for him. How he triumphed on every point\\nin his discussion with his father, when he wanted to bring him back to\\nmore worthy and honourable tastes!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. By Bacchus! \\'Tis some Evil Genius has brought this unbearable\\ndisorder into our house. The old man, full up with wine and excited by\\nthe sound of the flute, is so delighted, so enraptured, that he spends\\nthe night executing the old dances that Thespis first produced on the\\nstage,[163] and just now he offered to prove to the modern tragedians, by\\ndisputing with them for the dancing prize, that they are nothing but a\\nlot of old dotards.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. \"Who loiters at the door of the vestibule?\"[164]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Here comes our pest, our plague!\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Let down the barriers.[165] The dance is now to begin.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Or rather the madness.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Impetuous movement already twists and racks my sides. How my\\nnostrils wheeze! how my back cracks!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Go and fill yourself with hellebore.[166]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Phrynichus is as bold as a cock and terrifies his rivals.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh! oh! have a care he does not kick you.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. His leg kicks out sky-high, and his arse gapes open.[167]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Do have a care.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Look how easily my leg-joints move.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Great gods! What does all this mean? Is it actual, downright\\nmadness?\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. And now I summon and challenge my rivals. If there be a\\ntragic poet who pretends to be a skilful dancer, let him come and contest\\nthe matter with me. Is there one? Is there _not_ one?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Here comes one, and one only.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Who is the wretch?\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. \\'Tis the younger son of Carcinus.[168]\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. I will crush him to nothing; in point of keeping time, I will\\nknock him out, for he knows nothing of rhythm.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Ah! ah! here comes his brother too, another tragedian, and\\nanother son of Carcinus.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Him I will devour for my dinner.\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Oh! ye gods! I see nothing but crabs.[169] Here is yet\\nanother son of Carcinus.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. What is\\'t comes here?  A shrimp or a spider?[170]\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. \\'Tis a crab,[171]--a crabkin, the smallest of its kind; he\\nwrites tragedies.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Oh! Carcinus, how proud you should be of your brood! What a\\ncrowd of kinglets have come swooping down here!\\n\\nBDELYCLEON. Come, come, my poor father, you will have to measure yourself\\nagainst them.\\n\\nPHILOCLEON. Have pickle prepared for seasoning them, if I am bound to\\nprove the victor.\\n\\nCHORUS. Let us stand out of the way a little, so that they may twirl at\\ntheir ease. Come, illustrious children of this inhabitant of the briny,\\nbrothers of the shrimps, skip on the sand and the shore of the barren\\nsea; show us the lightning whirls and twirls of your nimble limbs.\\nGlorious offspring of Phrynichus,[172] let fly your kicks, so that the\\nspectators may be overjoyed at seeing your legs so high in air. Twist,\\ntwirl, tap your bellies, kick your legs to the sky. Here comes your\\nfamous father, the ruler of the sea,[173] delighted to see his three\\nlecherous kinglets.[174] Go on with your dancing, if it pleases you, but\\nas for us, we shall not join you. Lead us promptly off the stage, for\\nnever a Comedy yet was seen where the Chorus finished off with a dance.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFINIS OF \"THE WASPS\"', 'occupy the centre of the stage.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTHE BIRDS\\n\\n\\nEUELPIDES (_to his jay_).[175] Do you think I should walk straight for\\nyon tree?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS (_to his crow_). Cursed beast, what are you croaking to\\nme?... to retrace my steps?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Why, you wretch, we are wandering at random, we are exerting\\nourselves only to return to the same spot; \\'tis labour lost.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. To think that I should trust to this crow, which has made\\nme cover more than a thousand furlongs!\\n\\nEUELPIDES. And I to this jay, who has torn every nail from my fingers!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. If only I knew where we were. . . .\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Could you find your country again from here?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. No, I feel quite sure I could not, any more than could\\nExecestides[176] find his.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Oh dear! oh dear!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Aye, aye, my friend, \\'tis indeed the road of \"oh dears\" we\\nare following.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. That Philocrates, the bird-seller, played us a scurvy trick,\\nwhen he pretended these two guides could help us to find Tereus,[177] the\\nEpops, who is a bird, without being born of one. He has indeed sold us\\nthis jay, a true son of Tharelides,[178] for an obolus, and this crow for\\nthree, but what can they do? Why, nothing whatever but bite and\\nscratch!--What\\'s the matter with you then, that you keep opening your\\nbeak? Do you want us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks? There\\nis no road that way.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Not even the vestige of a track in any direction.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. And what does the crow say about the road to follow?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. By Zeus, it no longer croaks the same thing it did.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. And which way does it tell us to go now?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. It says that, by dint of gnawing, it will devour my\\nfingers.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. What misfortune is ours! we strain every nerve to get to the\\nbirds,[179] do everything we can to that end, and we cannot find our way!\\nYes, spectators, our madness is quite different to that of Sacas. He is\\nnot a citizen, and would fain be one at any cost; we, on the contrary,\\nborn of an honourable tribe and family and living in the midst of our\\nfellow-citizens, we have fled from our country as hard as ever we could\\ngo. \\'Tis not that we hate it; we recognize it to be great and rich,\\nlikewise that everyone has the right to ruin himself; but the crickets\\nonly chirrup among the fig-trees for a month or two, whereas the\\nAthenians spend their whole lives in chanting forth judgments from their\\nlaw courts.[180] That is why we started off with a basket, a stew-pot and\\nsome myrtle boughs[181] and have come to seek a quiet country in which to\\nsettle. We are going to Tereus, the Epops, to learn from him, whether, in\\nhis aerial flights, he has noticed some town of this kind.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Here! look!\\n\\nEUELPIDES. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Why, the crow has been pointing me to something up there\\nfor some time now.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. And the jay is also opening its beak and craning its neck to\\nshow me I know not what. Clearly, there are some birds about here. We\\nshall soon know, if we kick up a noise to start them.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Do you know what to do? Knock your leg against this rock.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. And you your head to double the noise.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Well then use a stone instead; take one and hammer with it.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Good idea! Ho there, within! Slave! slave!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What\\'s that, friend! You say, \"slave,\" to summon Epops!\\n\\'Twould be much better to shout, \"Epops, Epops!\"\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Well then, Epops! Must I knock again? Epops!\\n\\nTROCHILUS. Who\\'s there? Who calls my master?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Apollo the Deliverer! what an enormous beak![182]\\n\\nTROCHILUS. Good god! they are bird-catchers.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. The mere sight of him petrifies me with terror. What a\\nhorrible monster!\\n\\nTROCHILUS. Woe to you!\\n\\nEUELPIDES. But we are not men.\\n\\nTROCHILUS. What are you, then?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. I am the Fearling, an African bird.\\n\\nTROCHILUS. You talk nonsense.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Well, then, just ask it of my feet.[183]\\n\\nTROCHILUS. And this other one, what bird is it?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I? I am a Cackling,[184] from the land of the pheasants.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. But you yourself, in the name of the gods! what animal are\\nyou?\\n\\nTROCHILUS. Why, I am a slave-bird.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Why, have you been conquered by a cock?\\n\\nTROCHILUS. No, but when my master was turned into a peewit, he begged me\\nto become a bird too, to follow and to serve him.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Does a bird need a servant, then?\\n\\nTROCHILUS. \\'Tis no doubt because he was a man. At times he wants to eat a\\ndish of loach from Phalerum; I seize my dish and fly to fetch him some.\\nAgain he wants some pea-soup; I seize a ladle and a pot and run to get\\nit.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. This is, then, truly a running-bird.[185] Come, Trochilus, do\\nus the kindness to call your master.\\n\\nTROCHILUS. Why, he has just fallen asleep after a feed of myrtle-berries\\nand a few grubs.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Never mind; wake him up.\\n\\nTROCHILUS. I am certain he will be angry. However, I will wake him to\\nplease you.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. You cursed brute! why, I am almost dead with terror!\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Oh! my god! \\'twas sheer fear that made me lose my jay.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah! you great coward! were you so frightened that you let\\ngo your jay?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. And did you not lose your crow, when you fell sprawling on the\\nground? Pray tell me that.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. No, no.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Where is it, then?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. It has flown away.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Then you did not let it go! Oh! you brave fellow!\\n\\nEPOPS. Open the forest,[186] that I may go out!\\n\\nEUELPIDES. By Heracles! what a creature! what plumage! What means this\\ntriple crest?\\n\\nEPOPS. Who wants me?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. The twelve great gods have used you ill, meseems.\\n\\nEPOPS. Are you chaffing me about my feathers? I have been a man,\\nstrangers.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. \\'Tis not you we are jeering at.\\n\\nEPOPS. At what, then?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Why, \\'tis your beak that looks so odd to us.\\n\\nEPOPS. This is how Sophocles outrages me in his tragedies. Know, I once\\nwas Tereus.[187]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. You were Tereus, and what are you now? a bird or a\\npeacock?[188]\\n\\nEPOPS. I am a bird.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Then where are your feathers? For I don\\'t see them.\\n\\nEPOPS. They have fallen off.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Through illness.\\n\\nEPOPS. No. All birds moult their feathers, you know, every winter, and\\nothers grow in their place. But tell me, who are you?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. We? We are mortals.\\n\\nEPOPS. From what country?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. From the land of the beautiful galleys.[189]\\n\\nEPOPS. Are you dicasts?[190]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. No, if anything, we are anti-dicasts.\\n\\nEPOPS. Is that kind of seed sown among you?[191]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. You have to look hard to find even a little in our fields.\\n\\nEPOPS. What brings you here?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. We wish to pay you a visit.\\n\\nEPOPS. What for?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Because you formerly were a man, like we are, formerly you had\\ndebts, as we have, formerly you did not want to pay them, like ourselves;\\nfurthermore, being turned into a bird, you have when flying seen all\\nlands and seas. Thus you have all human knowledge as well as that of\\nbirds. And hence we have come to you to beg you to direct us to some cosy\\ntown, in which one can repose as if on thick coverlets.\\n\\nEPOPS. And are you looking for a greater city than Athens?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. No, not a greater, but one more pleasant to dwell in.\\n\\nEPOPS. Then you are looking for an aristocratic country.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. I? Not at all! I hold the son of Scellias in horror.[192]\\n\\nEPOPS. But, after all, what sort of city would please you best?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. A place where the following would be the most important\\nbusiness transacted.--Some friend would come knocking at the door quite\\nearly in the morning saying, \"By Olympian Zeus, be at my house early, as\\nsoon as you have bathed, and bring your children too. I am giving a\\nnuptial feast, so don\\'t fail, or else don\\'t cross my threshold when I am\\nin distress.\"\\n\\nEPOPS. Ah! that\\'s what may be called being fond of hardships. And what\\nsay you?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. My tastes are similar.\\n\\nEPOPS. And they are?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I want a town where the father of a handsome lad will stop\\nin the street and say to me reproachfully as if I had failed him, \"Ah! Is\\nthis well done, Stilbonides! You met my son coming from the bath after\\nthe gymnasium and you neither spoke to him, nor embraced him, nor took\\nhim with you, nor ever once twitched his testicles. Would anyone call you\\nan old friend of mine?\"\\n\\nEPOPS. Ah! wag, I see you are fond of suffering. But there is a city of\\ndelights, such as you want. \\'Tis on the Red Sea.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Oh, no. Not a sea-port, where some fine morning the\\nSalaminian[193] galley can appear, bringing a writ-server along. Have you\\nno Greek town you can propose to us?\\n\\nEPOPS. Why not choose Lepreum in Elis for your settlement?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. By Zeus! I could not look at Lepreum without disgust, because\\nof Melanthius.[194]\\n\\nEPOPS. Then, again, there is the Opuntian, where you could live.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. I would not be Opuntian[195] for a talent. But come, what is\\nit like to live with the birds? You should know pretty well.\\n\\nEPOPS. Why, \\'tis not a disagreeable life. In the first place, one has no\\npurse.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. That does away with much roguery.\\n\\nEPOPS. For food the gardens yield us white sesame, myrtle-berries,\\npoppies and mint.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Why, \\'tis the life of the newly-wed indeed.[196]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ha! I am beginning to see a great plan, which will transfer\\nthe supreme power to the birds, if you will but take my advice.\\n\\nEPOPS. Take your advice? In what way?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. In what way? Well, firstly, do not fly in all directions\\nwith open beak; it is not dignified. Among us, when we see a thoughtless\\nman, we ask, \"What sort of bird is this?\" and Teleas answers, \"\\'Tis a man\\nwho has no brain, a bird that has lost his head, a creature you cannot\\ncatch, for it never remains in any one place.\"\\n\\nEPOPS. By Zeus himself! your jest hits the mark. What then is to be done?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Found a city.\\n\\nEPOPS. We birds? But what sort of city should we build?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh, really, really! \\'tis spoken like a fool! Look down.\\n\\nEPOPS. I am looking.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Now look upwards.\\n\\nEPOPS. I am looking.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Turn your head round.\\n\\nEPOPS. Ah! \\'twill be pleasant for me, if I end in twisting my neck!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What have you seen?\\n\\nEPOPS. The clouds and the sky.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Very well! is not this the pole of the birds then?\\n\\nEPOPS. How their pole?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Or, if you like it, the land. And since it turns and passes\\nthrough the whole universe, it is called, \\'pole.\\'[197] If you build and\\nfortify it, you will turn your pole into a fortified city.[198] In this\\nway you will reign over mankind as you do over the grasshoppers and cause\\nthe gods to die of rabid hunger.\\n\\nEPOPS. How so?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. The air is \\'twixt earth and heaven. When we want to go to\\nDelphi, we ask the Boeotians[199] for leave of passage; in the same way,\\nwhen men sacrifice to the gods, unless the latter pay you tribute, you\\nexercise the right of every nation towards strangers and don\\'t allow the\\nsmoke of the sacrifices to pass through your city and territory.\\n\\nEPOPS. By earth! by snares! by network![200] I never heard of anything\\nmore cleverly conceived; and, if the other birds approve, I am going to\\nbuild the city along with you.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Who will explain the matter to them?\\n\\nEPOPS. You must yourself. Before I came they were quite ignorant, but\\nsince I have lived with them I have taught them to speak.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. But how can they be gathered together?\\n\\nEPOPS. Easily. I will hasten down to the coppice to waken my dear\\nProcné;[201] as soon as they hear our voices, they will come to us hot\\nwing.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. My dear bird, lose no time, I beg. Fly at once into the\\ncoppice and awaken Procné.\\n\\nEPOPS. Chase off drowsy sleep, dear companion. Let the sacred hymn gush\\nfrom thy divine throat in melodious strains; roll forth in soft cadence\\nyour refreshing melodies to bewail the fate of Itys,[202] which has been\\nthe cause of so many tears to us both. Your pure notes rise through the\\nthick leaves of the yew-tree right up to the throne of Zeus, where\\nPhoebus listens to you, Phoebus with his golden hair. And his ivory lyre\\nresponds to your plaintive accents; he gathers the choir of the gods and\\nfrom their immortal lips rushes a sacred chant of blessed voices. (_The\\nflute is played behind the scene._)\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! by Zeus! what a throat that little bird possesses. He\\nhas filled the whole coppice with honey-sweet melody!\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Hush!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Will you keep silence?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What for?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Epops is going to sing again.\\n\\nEPOPS (_in the coppice_). Epopoi, poi, popoi, epopoi, popoi, here, here,\\nquick, quick, quick, my comrades in the air; all you, who pillage the\\nfertile lands of the husbandmen, the numberless tribes who gather and\\ndevour the barley seeds, the swift flying race who sing so sweetly. And\\nyou whose gentle twitter resounds through the fields with the little cry\\nof tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio; and you who hop about the\\nbranches of the ivy in the gardens; the mountain birds, who feed on the\\nwild olive berries or the arbutus, hurry to come at my call, trioto,\\ntrioto, totobrix; you also, who snap up the sharp-stinging gnats in the\\nmarshy vales, and you who dwell in the fine plain of Marathon, all damp\\nwith dew, and you, the francolin with speckled wings; you too, the\\nhalcyons, who flit over the swelling waves of the sea, come hither to\\nhear the tidings; let all the tribes of long-necked birds assemble here;\\nknow that a clever old man has come to us, bringing an entirely new idea\\nand proposing great reforms. Let all come to the debate here, here, here,\\nhere. Torotorotorotorotix, kikkobau, kikkobau, torotorotorotorolililix.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Can you see any bird?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. By Phoebus, no! and yet I am straining my eyesight to scan the\\nsky.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Twas really not worth Epops\\' while to go and bury himself\\nin the thicket like a plover when a-hatching.\\n\\nPHOENICOPTERUS. Torotina, torotina.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Hold, friend, here is another bird.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. I\\' faith, yes! \\'tis a bird, but of what kind? Isn\\'t it a\\npeacock?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Epops will tell us. What is this bird?\\n\\nEPOPS. \\'Tis not one of those you are used to seeing; \\'tis a bird from the\\nmarshes.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! oh! but he is very handsome with his wings as crimson\\nas flame.\\n\\nEPOPS. Undoubtedly; indeed he is called flamingo.[203]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Hi! I say! You!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What are you shouting for?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Why, here\\'s another bird.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Aye, indeed; \\'tis a foreign bird too. What is this bird\\nfrom beyond the mountains with a look as solemn as it is stupid?\\n\\nEPOPS. He is called the Mede.[204]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. The Mede! But, by Heracles! how, if a Mede, has he flown\\nhere without a camel?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Here\\'s another bird with a crest.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah! that\\'s curious. I say, Epops, you are not the only one\\nof your kind then?\\n\\nEPOPS. This bird is the son of Philocles, who is the son of Epops;[205]\\nso that, you see, I am his grandfather; just as one might say,\\nHipponicus,[206] the son of Callias, who is the son of Hipponicus.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Then this bird is Callias! Why, what a lot of his feathers\\nhe has lost![207]\\n\\nEPOPS. That\\'s because he is honest; so the informers set upon him and the\\nwomen too pluck out his feathers.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. By Posidon, do you see that many-coloured bird? What is his\\nname?\\n\\nEPOPS. This one? \\'Tis the glutton.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Is there another glutton besides Cleonymus? But why, if he\\nis Cleonymus, has he not thrown away his crest?[208] But what is the\\nmeaning of all these crests? Have these birds come to contend for the\\ndouble stadium prize?[209]\\n\\nEPOPS. They are like the Carians, who cling to the crests of their\\nmountains for greater safety.[210]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh, Posidon! do you see what swarms of birds are gathering\\nhere?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. By Phoebus! what a cloud! The entrance to the stage is no\\nlonger visible, so closely do they fly together.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Here is the partridge.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Faith! there is the francolin.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. There is the poachard.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Here is the kingfisher. And over yonder?\\n\\nEPOPS. \\'Tis the barber.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. What? a bird a barber?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Why, Sporgilus is one.[211] Here comes the owl.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. And who is it brings an owl to Athens?[212]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Here is the magpie, the turtle-dove, the swallow, the\\nhorned owl, the buzzard, the pigeon, the falcon, the ring-dove, the\\ncuckoo, the red-foot, the red-cap, the purple-cap, the kestrel, the\\ndiver, the ousel, the osprey, the wood-pecker.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Oh! oh! what a lot of birds! what a quantity of blackbirds!\\nhow they scold, how they come rushing up! What a noise! what a noise! Can\\nthey be bearing us ill-will? Oh! there! there! they are opening their\\nbeaks and staring at us.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Why, so they are.\\n\\nCHORUS. Popopopopopopopoi. Where is he who called me? Where am I to find\\nhim?\\n\\nEPOPS. I have been waiting for you this long while; I never fail in my\\nword to my friends.\\n\\nCHORUS. Titititititititi. What good thing have you to tell me?\\n\\nEPOPS. Something that concerns our common safety, and that is just as\\npleasant as it is to the purpose. Two men, who are subtle reasoners, have\\ncome here to seek me.\\n\\nCHORUS. Where? What? What are you saying?\\n\\nEPOPS. I say, two old men have come from the abode of men to propose a\\nvast and splendid scheme to us.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! \\'tis a horrible, unheard-of crime! What are you saying?\\n\\nEPOPS. Nay! never let my words scare you.\\n\\nCHORUS. What have you done then?\\n\\nEPOPS. I have welcomed two men, who wish to live with us.\\n\\nCHORUS. And you have dared to do that!\\n\\nEPOPS. Aye, and am delighted at having done so.\\n\\nCHORUS. Where are they?\\n\\nEPOPS. In your midst, as I am.\\n\\nCHORUS. Ah! ah! we are betrayed; \\'tis sacrilege! Our friend, he who\\npicked up corn-seeds in the same plains as ourselves, has violated our\\nancient laws; he has broken the oaths that bind all birds; he has laid a\\nsnare for me, he has handed us over to the attacks of that impious race\\nwhich, throughout all time, has never ceased to war against us. As for\\nthis traitorous bird, we will decide his case later, but the two old men\\nshall be punished forthwith; we are going to tear them to pieces.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis all over with us.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. You are the sole cause of all our trouble. Why did you bring\\nme from down yonder?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. To have you with me.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Say rather to have me melt into tears.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Go to! you are talking nonsense.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. How so?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. How will you be able to cry when once your eyes are pecked\\nout?\\n\\nCHORUS. Io! io! forward to the attack, throw yourselves upon the foe,\\nspill his blood; take to your wings and surround them on all sides. Woe\\nto them! let us get to work with our beaks, let us devour them. Nothing\\ncan save them from our wrath, neither the mountain forests, nor the\\nclouds that float in the sky, nor the foaming deep. Come, peck, tear to\\nribbons. Where is the chief of the cohort? Let him engage the right wing.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. This is the fatal moment. Where shall I fly to, unfortunate\\nwretch that I am?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Stay!  stop here!\\n\\nEUELPIDES. That they may tear me to pieces?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. And how do you think to escape them?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. I don\\'t know at all.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Come, I will tell you. We must stop and fight them. Let us\\narm ourselves with these stew-pots.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Why with the stew-pots?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. The owl will not attack us.[213]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. But do you see all those hooked claws?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Seize the spit and pierce the foe on your side.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. And how about my eyes?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Protect them with this dish or this vinegar-pot.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Oh! what cleverness! what inventive genius! You are a great\\ngeneral, even greater than Nicias,[214] where stratagem is concerned.\\n\\nCHORUS. Forward, forward, charge with your beaks! Come, no delay. Tear,\\npluck, strike, flay them, and first of all smash the stew-pot.\\n\\nEPOPS. Oh, most cruel of all animals, why tear these two men to pieces,\\nwhy kill them? What have they done to you? They belong to the same tribe,\\nto the same family as my wife.[215]\\n\\nCHORUS. Are wolves to be spared? Are they not our most mortal foes? So\\nlet us punish them.\\n\\nEPOPS. If they are your foes by nature, they are your friends in heart,\\nand they come here to give you useful advice.\\n\\nCHORUS. Advice or a useful word from their lips, from them, the enemies\\nof my forbears!\\n\\nEPOPS. The wise can often profit by the lessons of a foe, for caution is\\nthe mother of safety. \\'Tis just such a thing as one will not learn from a\\nfriend and which an enemy compels you to know. To begin with, \\'tis the\\nfoe and not the friend that taught cities to build high walls, to equip\\nlong vessels of war; and \\'tis this knowledge that protects our children,\\nour slaves and our wealth.\\n\\nCHORUS. Well then, I agree, let us first hear them, for \\'tis best; one\\ncan even learn something in an enemy\\'s school.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Their wrath seems to cool. Draw back a little.\\n\\nEPOPS. \\'Tis only justice, and you will thank me later.\\n\\nCHORUS. Never have we opposed your advice up to now.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. They are in a more peaceful mood; put down your stew-pot\\nand your two dishes; spit in hand, doing duty for a spear, let us mount\\nguard inside the camp close to the pot and watch in our arsenal closely;\\nfor we must not fly.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. You are right. But where shall we be buried, if we die?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. In the Ceramicus;[216] for, to get a public funeral, we\\nshall tell the Strategi that we fell at Orneae,[217] fighting the\\ncountry\\'s foes.\\n\\nCHORUS. Return to your ranks and lay down your courage beside your wrath\\nas the Hoplites do. Then let us ask these men who they are, whence they\\ncome, and with what intent. Here, Epops, answer me.\\n\\nEPOPS. Are you calling me? What do you want of me?\\n\\nCHORUS. Who are they? From what country?\\n\\nEPOPS. Strangers, who have come from Greece, the land of the wise.\\n\\nCHORUS. And what fate has led them hither to the land of the birds?\\n\\nEPOPS. Their love for you and their wish to share your kind of life; to\\ndwell and remain with you always.\\n\\nCHORUS. Indeed, and what are their plans?\\n\\nEPOPS. They are wonderful, incredible, unheard of.\\n\\nCHORUS. Why, do they think to see some advantage that determines them to\\nsettle here? Are they hoping with our help to triumph over their foes or\\nto be useful to their friends?\\n\\nEPOPS. They speak of benefits so great it is impossible either to\\ndescribe or conceive them; all shall be yours, all that we see here,\\nthere, above and below us; this they vouch for.\\n\\nCHORUS. Are they mad?\\n\\nEPOPS. They are the sanest people in the world.\\n\\nCHORUS. Clever men?\\n\\nEPOPS. The slyest of foxes, cleverness its very self, men of the world,\\ncunning, the cream of knowing folk.\\n\\nCHORUS. Tell them to speak and speak quickly; why, as I listen to you, I\\nam beside myself with delight.\\n\\nEPOPS. Here, you there, take all these weapons and hang them up inside\\nclose to the fire, near the figure of the god who presides there and\\nunder his protection;[218] as for you, address the birds, tell them why I\\nhave gathered them together.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Not I, by Apollo, unless they agree with me as the little\\nape of an armourer agreed with his wife, not to bite me, nor pull me by\\nthe testicles, nor shove things up my....\\n\\nCHORUS. You mean the.... (_Puts finger to bottom._) Oh! be quite at ease.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. No, I mean my eyes.\\n\\nCHORUS. Agreed.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Swear it.\\n\\nCHORUS. I swear it and, if I keep my promise, let judges and spectators\\ngive me the victory unanimously.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. It is a bargain.\\n\\nCHORUS. And if I break my word, may I succeed by one vote only.\\n\\nHERALD. Hearken, ye people! Hoplites, pick up your weapons and return to\\nyour firesides; do not fail to read the decrees of dismissal we have\\nposted.\\n\\nCHORUS. Man is a truly cunning creature, but nevertheless explain.\\nPerhaps you are going to show me some good way to extend my power, some\\nway that I have not had the wit to find out and which you have\\ndiscovered. Speak! \\'tis to your own interest as well as to mine, for if\\nyou secure me some advantage, I will surely share it with you. But what\\nobject can have induced you to come among us? Speak boldly, for I shall\\nnot break the truce,--until you have told us all.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I am bursting with desire to speak; I have already mixed\\nthe dough of my address and nothing prevents me from kneading it....\\nSlave! bring the chaplet and water, which you must pour over my hands. Be\\nquick![219]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Is it a question of feasting? What does it all mean?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. By Zeus, no! but I am hunting for fine, tasty words to\\nbreak down the hardness of their hearts.--I grieve so much for you, who\\nat one time were kings....\\n\\nCHORUS. We kings! Over whom?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. ... of all that exists, firstly of me and of this man, even\\nof Zeus himself. Your race is older than Saturn, the Titans and the\\nEarth.\\n\\nCHORUS. What, older than the Earth!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. By Phoebus, yes.\\n\\nCHORUS. By Zeus, but I never knew that before!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis because you are ignorant and heedless, and have never\\nread your Aesop. \\'Tis he who tells us that the lark was born before all\\nother creatures, indeed before the Earth; his father died of sickness,\\nbut the Earth did not exist then; he remained unburied for five days,\\nwhen the bird in its dilemma decided, for want of a better place, to\\nentomb its father in its own head.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. So that the lark\\'s father is buried at Cephalae.[220]\\n\\nEPOPS. Hence, if we existed before the Earth, before the gods, the\\nkingship belongs to us by right of priority.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Undoubtedly, but sharpen your beak well; Zeus won\\'t be in a\\nhurry to hand over his sceptre to the woodpecker.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. It was not the gods, but the birds, who were formerly the\\nmasters and kings over men; of this I have a thousand proofs. First of\\nall, I will point you to the cock, who governed the Persians before all\\nother monarchs, before Darius and Megabyzus.[221] \\'Tis in memory of his\\nreign that he is called the Persian bird.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. For this reason also, even to-day, he alone of all the birds\\nwears his tiara straight on his head, like the Great King.[222]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. He was so strong, so great, so feared, that even now, on\\naccount of his ancient power, everyone jumps out of bed as soon as ever\\nhe crows at daybreak. Blacksmiths, potters, tanners, shoemakers, bathmen,\\ncorn-dealers, lyre-makers and armourers, all put on their shoes and go to\\nwork before it is daylight.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. I can tell you something anent that. \\'Twas the cock\\'s fault\\nthat I lost a splendid tunic of Phrygian wool. I was at a feast in town,\\ngiven to celebrate the birth of a child; I had drunk pretty freely and\\nhad just fallen asleep, when a cock, I suppose in a greater hurry than\\nthe rest, began to crow. I thought it was dawn and set out for\\nAlimos.[223] I had hardly got beyond the walls, when a footpad struck me\\nin the back with his bludgeon; down I went and wanted to shout, but he\\nhad already made off with my mantle.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Formerly also the kite was ruler and king over the Greeks.\\n\\nEPOPS. The Greeks?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. And when he was king, \\'twas he who first taught them to\\nfall on their knees before the kites.[224]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. By Zeus! \\'tis what I did myself one day on seeing a kite; but\\nat the moment I was on my knees, and leaning backwards[225] with mouth\\nagape, I bolted an obolus and was forced to carry my bag home empty.[226]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. The cuckoo was king of Egypt and of the whole of Phoenicia.\\nWhen he called out \"cuckoo,\" all the Phoenicians hurried to the fields to\\nreap their wheat and their barley.[227]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Hence no doubt the proverb, \"Cuckoo! cuckoo! go to the fields,\\nye circumcised.\"[228]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. So powerful were the birds, that the kings of Grecian\\ncities, Agamemnon, Menelaus, for instance, carried a bird on the tip of\\ntheir sceptres, who had his share of all presents.[229]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. That I didn\\'t know and was much astonished when I saw Priam\\ncome upon the stage in the tragedies with a bird, which kept watching\\nLysicrates[230] to see if he got any present.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. But the strongest proof of all is, that Zeus, who now\\nreigns, is represented as standing with an eagle on his head as a symbol\\nof his royalty;[231] his daughter has an owl, and Phoebus, as his\\nservant, has a hawk.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. By Demeter, \\'tis well spoken. But what are all these birds\\ndoing in heaven?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. When anyone sacrifices and, according to the rite, offers\\nthe entrails to the gods, these birds take their share before Zeus.\\nFormerly the men always swore by birds and never by the gods; even now\\nLampon[232] swears by the goose, when he wants to lie.... Thus \\'tis clear\\nthat you were great and sacred, but now you are looked upon as slaves, as\\nfools, as Helots; stones are thrown at you as at raving madmen, even in\\nholy places. A crowd of bird-catchers sets snares, traps, limed-twigs and\\nnets of all sorts for you; you are caught, you are sold in heaps and the\\nbuyers finger you over to be certain you are fat. Again, if they would\\nbut serve you up simply roasted; but they rasp cheese into a mixture of\\noil, vinegar and laserwort, to which another sweet and greasy sauce is\\nadded, and the whole is poured scalding hot over your back, for all the\\nworld as if you were diseased meat.\\n\\nCHORUS. Man, your words have made my heart bleed; I have groaned over the\\ntreachery of our fathers, who knew not how to transmit to us the high\\nrank they held from their forefathers. But \\'tis a benevolent Genius, a\\nhappy Fate, that sends you to us; you shall be our deliverer and I place\\nthe destiny of my little ones and my own in your hands with every\\nconfidence. But hasten to tell me what must be done; we should not be\\nworthy to live, if we did not seek to regain our royalty by every\\npossible means,\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. First I advise that the birds gather together in one city\\nand that they build a wall of great bricks, like that at Babylon, round\\nthe plains of the air and the whole region of space that divides earth\\nfrom heaven.\\n\\nEPOPS. Oh, Cebriones! oh, Porphyrion![233] what a terribly strong place!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. This, this being well done and completed, you demand back\\nthe empire from Zeus; if he will not agree, if he refuses and does not at\\nonce confess himself beaten, you declare a sacred war against him and\\nforbid the gods henceforward to pass through your country with standing\\norgan, as hitherto, for the purpose of fondling their Alcmenas, their\\nAlopés, or their Semelés;[234] if they try to pass through, you\\ninfibulate them with rings so that they can fuck no longer. You send\\nanother messenger to mankind, who will proclaim to them that the birds\\nare kings, that for the future they must first of all sacrifice to them,\\nand only afterwards to the gods; that it is fitting to appoint to each\\ndeity the bird that has most in common with it. For instance, are they\\nsacrificing to Aphrodité, let them at the same time offer barley to the\\ncoot;[235] are they immolating a sheep to Posidon, let them consecrate\\nwheat in honour of the duck;[236] is a steer being offered to Heracles,\\nlet honey-cakes be dedicated to the gull;[237] is a goat being slain for\\nKing Zeus, there is a King-Bird, the wren,[238] to whom the sacrifice of\\na male gnat is due before Zeus himself even.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. This notion of an immolated gnat delights me! And now let the\\ngreat Zeus thunder!\\n\\nEPOPS. But how will mankind recognize us as gods and not as jays? Us, who\\nhave wings and fly?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. You talk rubbish! Hermes is a god and has wings and flies,\\nand so do many other gods. First of all, Victory flies with golden wings,\\nEros is undoubtedly winged too, and Iris is compared by Homer to a\\ntimorous dove.[239] If men in their blindness do not recognize you as\\ngods and continue to worship the dwellers in Olympus, then a cloud of\\nsparrows greedy for corn must descend upon their fields and eat up all\\ntheir seeds; we shall see then if Demeter will mete them out any wheat.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. By Zeus, she\\'ll take good care she does not, and you will see\\nher inventing a thousand excuses.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. The crows too will prove your divinity to them by pecking\\nout the eyes of their flocks and of their draught-oxen; and then let\\nApollo cure them, since he is a physician and is paid for the\\npurpose.[240]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Oh! don\\'t do that! Wait first until I have sold my two young\\nbullocks.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. If on the other hand they recognize that you are God, the\\nprinciple of life, that you are Earth, Saturn, Posidon, they shall be\\nloaded with benefits.\\n\\nEPOPS Name me one of these then.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Firstly, the locusts shall not eat up their vine-blossoms;\\na legion of owls and kestrels will devour them. Moreover, the gnats and\\nthe gall-bugs shall no longer ravage the figs; a flock of thrushes shall\\nswallow the whole host down to the very last.\\n\\nEPOPS. And how shall we give wealth to mankind? This is their strongest\\npassion.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. When they consult the omens, you will point them to the\\nrichest mines, you will reveal the paying ventures to the diviner, and\\nnot another shipwreck will happen or sailor perish.\\n\\nEPOPS. No more shall perish? How is that?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. When the auguries are examined before starting on a voyage,\\nsome bird will not fail to say, \"Don\\'t start! there will be a storm,\" or\\nelse, \"Go! you will make a most profitable venture.\"\\n\\nEUELPIDES. I shall buy a trading-vessel and go to sea. I will not stay\\nwith you.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. You will discover treasures to them, which were buried in\\nformer times, for you know them. Do not all men say, \"None know where my\\ntreasure lies, unless perchance it be some bird.\"[241]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. I shall sell my boat and buy a spade to unearth the vessels.\\n\\nEPOPS. And how are we to give them health, which belongs to the gods?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. If they are happy, is not that the chief thing towards\\nhealth? The miserable man is never well.\\n\\nEPOPS. Old Age also dwells in Olympus. How will they get at it? Must they\\ndie in early youth?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Why, the birds, by Zeus, will add three hundred years to\\ntheir life.\\n\\nEPOPS. From whom will they take them?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. From whom? Why, from themselves. Don\\'t you know the cawing\\ncrow lives five times as long as a man?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Ah! ah! these are far better kings for us than Zeus!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Far better, are they not? And firstly, we shall not have to\\nbuild them temples of hewn stone, closed with gates of gold; they will\\ndwell amongst the bushes and in the thickets of green oak; the most\\nvenerated of birds will have no other temple than the foliage of the\\nolive tree; we shall not go to Delphi or to Ammon to sacrifice;[242] but\\nstanding erect in the midst of arbutus and wild olives and holding forth\\nour hands filled with wheat and barley, we shall pray them to admit us to\\na share of the blessings they enjoy and shall at once obtain them for a\\nfew grains of wheat.\\n\\nCHORUS. Old man, whom I detested, you are now to me the dearest of all;\\nnever shall I, if I can help it, fail to follow your advice. Inspirited\\nby your words, I threaten my rivals the gods, and I swear that if you\\nmarch in alliance with me against the gods and are faithful to our just,\\nloyal and sacred bond, we shall soon have shattered their sceptre. \\'Tis\\nour part to undertake the toil, \\'tis yours to advise.\\n\\nEPOPS. By Zeus! \\'tis no longer the time to delay and loiter like\\nNicias;[243] let us act as promptly as possible.... In the first place,\\ncome, enter my nest built of brushwood and blades of straw, and tell me\\nyour names.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. That is soon done; my name is Pisthetaerus.\\n\\nEPOPS. And his?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Euelpides, of the deme of Thria.\\n\\nEPOPS. Good! and good luck to you.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. We accept the omen.\\n\\nEPOPS. Come in here.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Very well, \\'tis you who lead us and must introduce us.\\n\\nEPOPS. Come then.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! my god! do come back here. Hi! tell us how we are to\\nfollow you. You can fly, but we cannot.\\n\\nEPOPS. Well, well.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Remember Aesop\\'s fables. It is told there, that the fox\\nfared very ill, because he had made an alliance with the eagle.\\n\\nEPOPS. Be at ease. You shall eat a certain root and wings will grow on\\nyour shoulders.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Then let us enter. Xanthias and Manes,[244] pick up our\\nbaggage.\\n\\nCHORUS. Hi! Epops!  do you hear me?\\n\\nEPOPS. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nCHORUS. Take them off to dine well and call your mate, the melodious\\nProcné, whose songs are worthy of the Muses; she will delight our leisure\\nmoments.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! I conjure you, accede to their wish; for this\\ndelightful bird will leave her rushes at the sound of your voice; for the\\nsake of the gods, let her come here, so that we may contemplate the\\nnightingale.[245]\\n\\nEPOPS. Let it be as you desire. Come forth, Procné, show yourself to\\nthese strangers.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! great Zeus! what a beautiful little bird! what a dainty\\nform! what brilliant plumage![246]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Do you know how dearly I should like to split her legs for\\nher?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. She is dazzling all over with gold, like a young girl.[247]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Oh! how I should like to kiss her!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Why, wretched man, she has two little sharp points on her\\nbeak.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. I would treat her like an egg, the shell of which we remove\\nbefore eating it; I would take off her mask and then kiss her pretty\\nface.\\n\\nEPOPS. Let us go in.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Lead the way, and may success attend us.\\n\\nCHORUS. Lovable golden bird, whom I cherish above all others, you, whom I\\nassociate with all my songs, nightingale, you have come, you have come,\\nto show yourself to me and to charm me with your notes. Come, you, who\\nplay spring melodies upon the harmonious flute,[248] lead off our\\nanapaests.[249]\\n\\nWeak mortals, chained to the earth, creatures of clay as frail as the\\nfoliage of the woods, you unfortunate race, whose life is but darkness,\\nas unreal as a shadow, the illusion of a dream, hearken to us, who are\\nimmortal beings, ethereal, ever young and occupied with eternal thoughts,\\nfor we shall teach you about all celestial matters; you shall know\\nthoroughly what is the nature of the birds, what the origin of the gods,\\nof the rivers, of Erebus, and Chaos; thanks to us, Prodicus[250] will\\nenvy you your knowledge.\\n\\nAt the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus, and deep\\nTartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. Firstly,\\nblack-winged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps\\nof Erebus, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the\\ngraceful Eros with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds\\nof the tempest. He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like\\nhimself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the\\nlight. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought\\ntogether all the ingredients of the world, and from their marriage\\nHeaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable race of blessed gods sprang\\ninto being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the dwellers\\nin Olympus. We are the offspring of Eros; there are a thousand proofs to\\nshow it. We have wings and we lend assistance to lovers. How many\\nhandsome youths, who had sworn to remain insensible, have not been\\nvanquished by our power and have yielded themselves to their lovers when\\nalmost at the end of their youth, being led away by the gift of a quail,\\na waterfowl, a goose, or a cock.[251]\\n\\nAnd what important services do not the birds render to mortals! First of\\nall, they mark the seasons for them, springtime, winter, and autumn. Does\\nthe screaming crane migrate to Libya,--it warns the husbandman to sow,\\nthe pilot to take his ease beside his tiller hung up in his\\ndwelling,[252] and Orestes[253] to weave a tunic, so that the rigorous\\ncold may not drive him any more to strip other folk. When the kite\\nreappears, he tells of the return of spring and of the period when the\\nfleece of the sheep must be clipped. Is the swallow in sight? All hasten\\nto sell their warm tunic and to buy some light clothing. We are your\\nAmmon, Delphi, Dodona, your Phoebus Apollo.[254] Before undertaking\\nanything, whether a business transaction, a marriage, or the purchase of\\nfood, you consult the birds by reading the omens, and you give this name\\nof omen[255] to all signs that tell of the future. With you a word is an\\nomen, you call a sneeze an omen, a meeting an omen, an unknown sound an\\nomen, a slave or an ass an omen.[256] Is it not clear that we are a\\nprophetic Apollo to you? If you recognize us as gods, we shall be your\\ndivining Muses, through us you will know the winds and the seasons,\\nsummer, winter, and the temperate months. We shall not withdraw ourselves\\nto the highest clouds like Zeus, but shall be among you and shall give to\\nyou and to your children and the children of your children, health and\\nwealth, long life, peace, youth, laughter, songs and feasts; in short,\\nyou will all be so well off, that you will be weary and satiated with\\nenjoyment.\\n\\nOh, rustic Muse of such varied note, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx, I sing with\\nyou in the groves and on the mountain tops, tio, tio, tio, tio,\\ntiotinx.[257] I pour forth sacred strains from my golden throat in honour\\nof the god Pan,[258] tio, tio, tio, tiotinx, from the top of the thickly\\nleaved ash, and my voice mingles with the mighty choirs who extol Cybelé\\non the mountain tops,[259] tototototototototinx. \\'Tis to our concerts\\nthat Phrynicus comes to pillage like a bee the ambrosia of his songs, the\\nsweetness of which so charms the ear, tio, tio, tio, tio, tinx.\\n\\nIf there be one of you spectators who wishes to spend the rest of his\\nlife quietly among the birds, let him come to us. All that is disgraceful\\nand forbidden by law on earth is on the contrary honourable among us, the\\nbirds. For instance, among you \\'tis a crime to beat your father, but with\\nus \\'tis an estimable deed; it\\'s considered fine to run straight at your\\nfather and hit him, saying, \"Come, lift your spur if you want to\\nfight.\"[260] The runaway slave, whom you brand, is only a spotted\\nfrancolin with us.[261] Are you Phrygian like Spintharus?[262] Among us\\nyou would be the Phrygian bird, the goldfinch, of the race of\\nPhilemon.[263] Are you a slave and a Carian like Execestides? Among us\\nyou can create yourself forefathers;[264] you can always find relations.\\nDoes the son of Pisias want to betray the gates of the city to the foe?\\nLet him become a partridge, the fitting offspring of his father; among us\\nthere is no shame in escaping as cleverly as a partridge.\\n\\nSo the swans on the banks of the Hebrus, tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx,\\nmingle their voices to serenade Apollo, tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx,\\nflapping their wings the while, tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx; their notes\\nreach beyond the clouds of heaven; all the dwellers in the forests stand\\nstill with astonishment and delight; a calm rests upon the waters, and\\nthe Graces and the choirs in Olympus catch up the strain, tio, tio, tio,\\ntio, tiotinx.\\n\\nThere is nothing more useful nor more pleasant than to have wings. To\\nbegin with, just let us suppose a spectator to be dying with hunger and\\nto be weary of the choruses of the tragic poets; if he were winged, he\\nwould fly off, go home to dine and come back with his stomach filled.\\nSome Patroclides in urgent need would not have to soil his cloak, but\\ncould fly off, satisfy his requirements, and, having recovered his\\nbreath, return. If one of you, it matters not who, had adulterous\\nrelations and saw the husband of his mistress in the seats of the\\nsenators, he might stretch his wings, fly thither, and, having appeased\\nhis craving, resume his place. Is it not the most priceless gift of all,\\nto be winged? Look at Diitrephes![265] His wings were only wicker-work\\nones, and yet he got himself chosen Phylarch and then Hipparch; from\\nbeing nobody, he has risen to be famous; \\'tis now the finest gilded cock\\nof his tribe.[266]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Halloa! What\\'s this? By Zeus! I never saw anything so funny\\nin all my life.[267]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. What makes you laugh?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis your bits of wings. D\\'you know what you look like?\\nLike a goose painted by some dauber-fellow.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. And you look like a close-shaven blackbird.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis ourselves asked for this transformation, and, as\\nAeschylus has it, \"These are no borrowed feathers, but truly our\\nown.\"[268]\\n\\nEPOPS. Come now, what must be done?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. First give our city a great and famous name, then sacrifice\\nto the gods.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. I think so too.\\n\\nEPOPS. Let\\'s see. What shall our city be called?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Will you have a high-sounding Laconian name? Shall we call\\nit Sparta?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. What! call my town Sparta? Why, I would not use esparto for my\\nbed,[269] even though I had nothing but bands of rushes.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Well then, what name can you suggest?\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Some name borrowed from the clouds, from these lofty regions\\nin which we dwell--in short, some well-known name.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Do you like Nephelococcygia?[270]\\n\\nEPOPS. Oh! capital! truly \\'tis a brilliant thought!\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Is it in Nephelococcygia that all the wealth of Theogenes[271]\\nand most of Aeschines\\'[272] is?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. No, \\'tis rather the plain of Phlegra,[273] where the gods\\nwithered the pride of the sons of the Earth with their shafts.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Oh! what a splendid city! But what god shall be its patron?\\nfor whom shall we weave the peplus?[274]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Why not choose Athené Polias?[275]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Oh! what a well-ordered town \\'twould be to have a female deity\\narmed from head to foot, while Clisthenes[276] was spinning!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Who then shall guard the Pelargicon?[277]\\n\\nEPOPS. One of ourselves, a bird of Persian strain, who is everywhere\\nproclaimed to be the bravest of all, a true chick of Ares.[278]\\n\\nEUELPIDES. Oh! noble chick! what a well-chosen god for a rocky home!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Come! into the air with you to help the workers, who are\\nbuilding the wall; carry up rubble, strip yourself to mix the mortar,\\ntake up the hod, tumble down the ladder, an you like, post sentinels,\\nkeep the fire smouldering beneath the ashes, go round the walls, bell in\\nhand,[279] and go to sleep up there yourself; then despatch two heralds,\\none to the gods above, the other to mankind on earth and come back here.\\n\\nEUELPIDES. As for yourself, remain here, and may the plague take you for\\na troublesome fellow!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Go, friend, go where I send you, for without you my orders\\ncannot be obeyed. For myself, I want to sacrifice to the new god, and I\\nam going to summon the priest who must preside at the ceremony. Slaves!\\nslaves! bring forward the basket and the lustral water.\\n\\nCHORUS. I do as you do, and I wish as you wish, and I implore you to\\naddress powerful and solemn prayers to the gods, and in addition to\\nimmolate a sheep as a token of our gratitude. Let us sing the Pythian\\nchant in honour of the god, and let Chaeris accompany our voices.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS (_to the flute-player_). Enough! but, by Heracles! what is\\nthis? Great gods! I have seen many prodigious things, but I never saw a\\nmuzzled raven.[280]\\n\\nEPOPS. Priest! \\'tis high time! Sacrifice to the new gods.\\n\\nPRIEST. I begin, but where is he with the basket? Pray to the Vesta of\\nthe birds, to the kite, who presides over the hearth, and to all the god\\nand goddess-birds who dwell in Olympus.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! Hawk, the sacred guardian of Sunium, oh, god of the storks!\\n\\nPRIEST. Pray to the swan of Delos, to Latona the mother of the quails,\\nand to Artemis, the goldfinch.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis no longer Artemis Colaenis, but Artemis the\\ngoldfinch.[281]\\n\\nPRIEST. And to Bacchus, the finch and Cybelé, the ostrich and mother of\\nthe gods and mankind.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! sovereign ostrich, Cybelé, the mother of Cleocritus,[282]\\ngrant health and safety to the Nephelococcygians as well as to the\\ndwellers in Chios....\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. The dwellers in Chios! Ah! I am delighted they should be\\nthus mentioned on all occasions.[283]\\n\\nCHORUS. ... to the heroes, the birds, to the sons of heroes, to the\\nporphyrion, the pelican, the spoon-bill, the redbreast, the grouse, the\\npeacock, the horned-owl, the teal, the bittern, the heron, the stormy\\npetrel, the fig-pecker, the titmouse....\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Stop! stop! you drive me crazy with your endless list. Why,\\nwretch, to what sacred feast are you inviting the vultures and the\\nsea-eagles? Don\\'t you see that a single kite could easily carry off the\\nlot at once? Begone, you and your fillets and all; I shall know how to\\ncomplete the sacrifice by myself.\\n\\nPRIEST. It is imperative that I sing another sacred chant for the rite of\\nthe lustral water, and that I invoke the immortals, or at least one of\\nthem, provided always that you have some suitable food to offer him; from\\nwhat I see here, in the shape of gifts, there is naught whatever but horn\\nand hair.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Let us address our sacrifices and our prayers to the winged\\ngods.\\n\\nA POET. Oh, Muse! celebrate happy Nephelococcygia in your hymns.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What have we here? Where do you come from, tell me? Who are\\nyou?\\n\\nPOET. I am he whose language is sweeter than honey, the zealous slave of\\nthe Muses, as Homer has it.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. You a slave! and yet you wear your hair long?\\n\\nPOET. No, but the fact is all we poets are the assiduous slaves of the\\nMuses according to Homer.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. In truth your little cloak is quite holy too through zeal!\\nBut, poet, what ill wind drove you here?\\n\\nPOET. I have composed verses in honour of your Nephelococcygia, a host of\\nsplendid dithyrambs and parthenians,[284] worthy of Simonides himself.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. And when did you compose them? How long since?\\n\\nPOET. Oh! \\'tis long, aye, very long, that I have sung in honour of this\\ncity.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. But I am only celebrating its foundation with this\\nsacrifice;[285] I have only just named it, as is done with little babies.\\n\\nPOET. \"Just as the chargers fly with the speed of the wind, so does the\\nvoice of the Muses take its flight. Oh! thou noble founder of the town of\\nAetna,[286] thou, whose name recalls the holy sacrifices,[287] make us\\nsuch gift as thy generous heart shall suggest.\"\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. He will drive us silly if we do not get rid of him by some\\npresent. Here! you, who have a fur as well as your tunic, take it off and\\ngive it to this clever poet. Come, take this fur; you look to me to be\\nshivering with cold.\\n\\nPOET. My Muse will gladly accept this gift; but engrave these verses of\\nPindar\\'s on your mind.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! what a pest! \\'Tis impossible then to be rid of him.\\n\\nPOET. \"Straton wanders among the Scythian nomads, but has no linen\\ngarment. He is sad at only wearing an animal\\'s pelt and no tunic.\" Do you\\nconceive my bent?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I understand that you want me to offer you a tunic. Hi! you\\n(_to Euelpides_), take off yours; we must help the poet.... Come, you,\\ntake it and begone.\\n\\nPOET. I am going, and these are the verses that I address to this city:\\n\"Phoebus of the golden throne, celebrate this shivery, freezing city; I\\nhave travelled through fruitful and snow-covered plains. Tralala!\\nTralala!\"[288]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What are you chanting us about frosts? Thanks to the tunic,\\nyou no longer fear them. Ah! by Zeus! I could not have believed this\\ncursed fellow could so soon have learnt the way to our city. Come,\\npriest, take the lustral water and circle the altar.\\n\\nPRIEST. Let all keep silence!\\n\\nA PROPHET. Let not the goat be sacrificed.[289]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Who are you?\\n\\nPROPHET. Who am I? A prophet.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Get you gone.\\n\\nPROPHET. Wretched man, insult not sacred things. For there is an oracle\\nof Bacis, which exactly applies to Nephelococcygia.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Why did you not reveal it to me before I founded my city?\\n\\nPROPHET. The divine spirit was against it.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Well, \\'tis best to know the terms of the oracle.\\n\\nPROPHET. \"But when the wolves and the white crows shall dwell together\\nbetween Corinth and Sicyon....\"[290]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. But how do the Corinthians concern me?\\n\\nPROPHET. \\'Tis the regions of the air that Bacis indicated in this manner.\\n\"They must first sacrifice a white-fleeced goat to Pandora, and give the\\nprophet, who first reveals my words, a good cloak and new sandals.\"\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Are the sandals there?\\n\\nPROPHET.\\n\\nRead. \"And besides this a goblet of wine and a good share of the entrails\\nof the victim.\"\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Of the entrails--is it so written?\\n\\nPROPHET. Read. \"If you do as I command, divine youth, you shall be an\\neagle among the clouds; if not, you shall be neither turtle-dove, nor\\neagle, nor woodpecker.\"\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Is all that there?\\n\\nPROPHET. Read.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. This oracle in no sort of way resembles the one Apollo\\ndictated to me: \"If an impostor comes without invitation to annoy you\\nduring the sacrifice and to demand a share of the victim, apply a stout\\nstick to his ribs.\"\\n\\nPROPHET. You are drivelling.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \"And don\\'t spare him, were he an eagle from out of the\\nclouds, were it Lampon himself[291] or the great Diopithes.\"[292]\\n\\nPROPHET. Is all that there?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Here, read it yourself, and go and hang yourself.\\n\\nPROPHET. Oh! unfortunate wretch that I am.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Away with you, and take your prophecies elsewhere.\\n\\nMETON.[293] I have come to you.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Yet another pest. What have you come to do? What\\'s your\\nplan? What\\'s the purpose of your journey? Why these splendid buskins?\\n\\nMETON. I want to survey the plains of the air for you and to parcel them\\ninto lots.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. In the name of the gods, who are you?\\n\\nMETON. Who am I? Meton, known throughout Greece and at Colonus.[294]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What are these things?\\n\\nMETON. Tools for measuring the air. In truth, the spaces in the air have\\nprecisely the form of a furnace. With this bent ruler I draw a line from\\ntop to bottom; from one of its points I describe a circle with the\\ncompass. Do you understand?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Not the very least.\\n\\nMETON. With the straight ruler I set to work to inscribe a square within\\nthis circle; in its centre will be the marketplace, into which all the\\nstraight streets will lead, converging to this centre like a star, which,\\nalthough only orbicular, sends forth its rays in a straight line from all\\nsides.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Meton, you new Thales....[295]\\n\\nMETON. What d\\'you want with me?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I want to give you a proof of my friendship. Use your legs.\\n\\nMETON. Why, what have I to fear?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis the same here as in Sparta. Strangers are driven away,\\nand blows rain down as thick as hail.\\n\\nMETON. Is there sedition in your city?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. No, certainly not.\\n\\nMETON. What\\'s wrong then?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. We are agreed to sweep all quacks and impostors far from\\nour borders.\\n\\nMETON. Then I\\'m off.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I fear me \\'tis too late. The thunder growls already.\\n(_Beats him._)\\n\\nMETON. Oh, woe! oh, woe!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I warned you. Now, be off, and do your surveying somewhere\\nelse. (_Meton takes to his heels._)\\n\\nAN INSPECTOR. Where are the Proxeni?[296]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Who is this Sardanapalus?[297]\\n\\nINSPECTOR. I have been appointed by lot to come to Nephelococcygia as\\ninspector.[298]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. An inspector! and who sends you here, you rascal?\\n\\nINSPECTOR. A decree of Taleas.[299]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Will you just pocket your salary, do nothing, and be off?\\n\\nINSPECTOR. I\\' faith! that I will; I am urgently needed to be at Athens to\\nattend the assembly; for I am charged with the interests of\\nPharnaces.[300]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Take it then, and be off. See, here is your salary. (_Beats\\nhim._)\\n\\nINSPECTOR. What does this mean?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis the assembly where you have to defend Pharnaces.\\n\\nINSPECTOR. You shall testify that they dare to strike me, the inspector.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Are you not going to clear out with your urns. \\'Tis not to\\nbe believed; they send us inspectors before we have so much as paid\\nsacrifice to the gods.\\n\\nA DEALER IN DECREES. \"If the Nephelococcygian does wrong to the\\nAthenian....\"\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Now whatever are these cursed parchments?\\n\\nDEALER IN DECREES. I am a dealer in decrees, and I have come here to sell\\nyou the new laws.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Which?\\n\\nDEALER IN DECREES. \"The Nephelococcygians shall adopt the same weights,\\nmeasures and decrees as the Olophyxians.\"[301]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. And you shall soon be imitating the Ototyxians. (_Beats\\nhim._)\\n\\nDEALER IN DECREES. Hullo! what are you doing?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Now will you be off with your decrees? For I am going to\\nlet _you_ see some severe ones.\\n\\nINSPECTOR (_returning_). I summon Pisthetaerus for outrage for the month\\nof Munychion.[302]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ha! my friend! are you still there?\\n\\nDEALER IN DECREES. \"Should anyone drive away the magistrates and not\\nreceive them, according to the decree duly posted...\"\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What! rascal! you are there too?\\n\\nINSPECTOR. Woe to you! I\\'ll have you condemned to a fine of ten thousand\\ndrachmae.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. And I\\'ll smash your urns.[303]\\n\\nINSPECTOR. Do you recall that evening when you stooled against the column\\nwhere the decrees are posted?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Here! here! let him be seized. (_The inspectors run off._)\\nWell! don\\'t you want to stop any longer?\\n\\nPRIEST. Let us get indoors as quick as possible; we will sacrifice the\\ngoat inside.[304]\\n\\nCHORUS. Henceforth it is to me that mortals must address their sacrifices\\nand their prayers. Nothing escapes my sight nor my might. My glance\\nembraces the universe, I preserve the fruit in the flower by destroying\\nthe thousand kinds of voracious insects the soil produces, which attack\\nthe trees and feed on the germ when it has scarcely formed in the calyx;\\nI destroy those who ravage the balmy terrace gardens like a deadly\\nplague; all these gnawing crawling creatures perish beneath the lash of\\nmy wing. I hear it proclaimed everywhere: \"A talent for him who shall\\nkill Diagoras of Melos,[305] and a talent for him who destroys one of the\\ndead tyrants.\"[306] We likewise wish to make our proclamation: \"A talent\\nto him among you who shall kill Philocrates, the Strouthian;[307] four,\\nif he brings him to us alive. For this Philocrates skewers the finches\\ntogether and sells them at the rate of an obolus for seven. He tortures\\nthe thrushes by blowing them out, so that they may look bigger, sticks\\ntheir own feathers into the nostrils of blackbirds, and collects pigeons,\\nwhich he shuts up and forces them, fastened in a net, to decoy others.\"\\nThat is what we wish to proclaim. And if anyone is keeping birds shut up\\nin his yard, let him hasten to let them loose; those who disobey shall be\\nseized by the birds and we shall put them in chains, so that in their\\nturn they may decoy other men.\\n\\nHappy indeed is the race of winged birds who need no cloak in winter!\\nNeither do I fear the relentless rays of the fiery dog-days; when the\\ndivine grasshopper, intoxicated with the sunlight, when noon is burning\\nthe ground, is breaking out into shrill melody, my home is beneath the\\nfoliage in the flowery meadows. I winter in deep caverns, where I frolic\\nwith the mountain nymphs, while in spring I despoil the gardens of the\\nGraces and gather the white, virgin berry on the myrtle bushes.\\n\\nI want now to speak to the judges about the prize they are going to\\naward; if they are favourable to us, we will load them with benefits far\\ngreater than those Paris[308] received. Firstly, the owls of\\nLaurium,[309] which every judge desires above all things, shall never be\\nwanting to you; you shall see them homing with you, building their nests\\nin your money-bags and laying coins. Besides, you shall be housed like\\nthe gods, for we shall erect gables[310] over your dwellings; if you hold\\nsome public post and want to do a little pilfering, we will give you the\\nsharp claws of a hawk. Are you dining in town, we will provide you with\\ncrops.[311] But, if your award is against us, don\\'t fail to have metal\\ncovers fashioned for yourselves, like those they place over statues;[312]\\nelse, look out! for the day you wear a white tunic all the birds will\\nsoil it with their droppings.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Birds! the sacrifice is propitious. But I see no messenger\\ncoming from the wall to tell us what is happening. Ah! here comes one\\nrunning himself out of breath as though he were running the Olympic\\nstadium.\\n\\nMESSENGER. Where, where is he? Where, where, where is he? Where, where,\\nwhere is he? Where is Pisthetaerus, our leader?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Here am I.\\n\\nMESSENGER. The wall is finished.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. That\\'s good news.\\n\\nMESSENGER. \\'Tis a most beautiful, a most magnificent work of art. The\\nwall is so broad, that Proxenides, the Braggartian, and Theogenes could\\npass each other in their chariots, even if they were drawn by steeds as\\nbig as the Trojan horse.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis wonderful!\\n\\nMESSENGER. Its length is one hundred stadia; I measured it myself.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. A decent length, by Posidon! And who built such a wall?\\n\\nMESSENGER. Birds--birds only; they had neither Egyptian brickmaker, nor\\nstonemason, nor carpenter; the birds did it all themselves, I could\\nhardly believe my eyes. Thirty thousand cranes came from Libya with a\\nsupply of stones,[313] intended for the foundations. The water-rails\\nchiselled them with their beaks. Ten thousand storks were busy making\\nbricks; plovers and other water fowl carried water into the air.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. And who carried the mortar?\\n\\nMESSENGER. Herons, in hods.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. But how could they put the mortar into hods?\\n\\nMESSENGER. Oh! \\'twas a truly clever invention; the geese used their feet\\nlike spades; they buried them in the pile of mortar and then emptied them\\ninto the hods.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah! to what use cannot feet be put?[314]\\n\\nMESSENGER. You should have seen how eagerly the ducks carried bricks. To\\ncomplete the tale, the swallows came flying to the work, their beaks full\\nof mortar and their trowel on their back, just the way little children\\nare carried.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Who would want paid servants after this? But, tell me, who\\ndid the woodwork?\\n\\nMESSENGER. Birds again, and clever carpenters too, the pelicans, for they\\nsquared up the gates with their beaks in such a fashion that one would\\nhave thought they were using axes; the noise was just like a dockyard.\\nNow the whole wall is tight everywhere, securely bolted and well guarded;\\nit is patrolled, bell in hand; the sentinels stand everywhere and beacons\\nburn on the towers. But I must run off to clean myself; the rest is your\\nbusiness.\\n\\nCHORUS. Well! what do you say to it? Are you not astonished at the wall\\nbeing completed so quickly?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. By the gods, yes, and with good reason. \\'Tis really not to\\nbe believed. But here comes another messenger from the wall to bring us\\nsome further news! What a fighting look he has!\\n\\nSECOND MESSENGER. Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nSECOND MESSENGER. A horrible outrage has occurred; a god sent by Zeus has\\npassed through our gates and has penetrated the realms of the air without\\nthe knowledge of the jays, who are on guard in the daytime.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Tis an unworthy and criminal deed. What god was it?\\n\\nSECOND MESSENGER. We don\\'t know that. All we know is, that he has got\\nwings.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Why were not guards sent against him at once?\\n\\nSECOND MESSENGER. We have despatched thirty thousand hawks of the legion\\nof mounted archers.[315] All the hook-clawed birds are moving against\\nhim, the kestrel, the buzzard, the vulture, the great-horned owl; they\\ncleave the air, so that it resounds with the flapping of their wings;\\nthey are looking everywhere for the god, who cannot be far away; indeed,\\nif I mistake not, he is coming from yonder side.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. All arm themselves with slings and bows! This way, all our\\nsoldiers; shoot and strike! Some one give me a sling!\\n\\nCHORUS. War, a terrible war is breaking out between us and the gods!\\nCome, let each one guard the Air, the son of Erebus,[316] in which the\\nclouds float. Take care no immortal enters it without your knowledge.\\nScan all sides with your glance. Hark! methinks I can hear the rustle of\\nthe swift wings of a god from heaven.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Hi! you woman! where are you flying to? Halt, don\\'t stir!\\nkeep motionless! not a beat of your wing!--Who are you and from what\\ncountry? You must say whence you come.[317]\\n\\nIRIS. I come from the abode of the Olympian gods.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What\\'s your name, ship or cap?[318]\\n\\nIRIS. I am swift Iris.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Paralus or Salaminia?[319]\\n\\nIRIS. What do you mean?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Let a buzzard rush at her and seize her.[320]\\n\\nIRIS. Seize me! But what do all these insults betoken?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Woe to you!\\n\\nIRIS. \\'Tis incomprehensible.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. By which gate did you pass through the wall, wretched\\nwoman?\\n\\nIRIS. By which gate? Why, great gods, I don\\'t know.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. You hear how she holds us in derision. Did you present\\nyourself to the officers in command of the jays? You don\\'t answer. Have\\nyou a permit, bearing the seal of the storks?\\n\\nIRIS. Am I awake?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Did you get one?\\n\\nIRIS. Are you mad?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. No head-bird gave you a safe-conduct?\\n\\nIRIS. A safe-conduct to me, you poor fool!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah! and so you slipped into this city on the sly and into\\nthese realms of air-land that don\\'t belong to you.\\n\\nIRIS. And what other road can the gods travel?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. By Zeus! I know nothing about that, not I. But they won\\'t\\npass this way. And you still dare to complain! Iris would ever have more\\njustly suffered death.\\n\\nIRIS. I am immortal.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. You would have died nevertheless.--Oh! \\'twould be truly\\nintolerable! What! should the universe obey us and the gods alone\\ncontinue their insolence and not understand that they must submit to the\\nlaw of the strongest in their due turn? But tell me, where are you flying\\nto?\\n\\nIRIS. I? The messenger of Zeus to mankind, I am going to tell them to\\nsacrifice sheep and oxen on the altars and to fill their streets with the\\nrich smoke of burning fat.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Of which gods are you speaking?\\n\\nIRIS. Of which?  Why, of ourselves, the gods of heaven.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. You, gods?\\n\\nIRIS. Are there others then?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Men now adore the birds as gods, and \\'tis to them, by Zeus,\\nthat they must offer sacrifices, and not to Zeus at all!\\n\\nIRIS. Oh! fool! fool! Rouse not the wrath of the gods, for \\'tis terrible\\nindeed. Armed with the brand of Zeus, Justice would annihilate your race;\\nthe lightning would strike you as it did Lycimnius and consume both your\\nbody and the porticos of your palace.[321]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Here! that\\'s enough tall talk. Just you listen and keep\\nquiet! Do you take me for a Lydian or a Phrygian[322] and think to\\nfrighten me with your big words? Know, that if Zeus worries me again, I\\nshall go at the head of my eagles, who are armed with lightning, and\\nreduce his dwelling and that of Amphion to cinders.[323] I shall send\\nmore than six hundred porphyrions clothed in leopards\\' skins[324] up to\\nheaven against him; and formerly a single Porphyrion gave him enough to\\ndo. As for you, his messenger, if you annoy me, I shall begin by\\nstretching your legs asunder and so conduct myself, Iris though you be,\\nthat despite my age, you will be astonished. I will show you a fine long\\ntool that will fuck you three times over.\\n\\nIRIS. May you perish, you wretch, you and your infamous words!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Won\\'t you be off quickly? Come, stretch your wings or look\\nout for squalls!\\n\\nIRIS. If my father does not punish you for your insults....\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ha!... but just you be off elsewhere to roast younger folk\\nthan us with your lightning.\\n\\nCHORUS. We forbid the gods, the sons of Zeus, to pass through our city\\nand the mortals to send them the smoke of their sacrifices by this road.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis odd that the messenger we sent to the mortals has\\nnever returned.\\n\\nHERALD. Oh! blessed Pisthetaerus, very wise, very illustrious, very\\ngracious, thrice happy, very.... Come, prompt me, somebody, do.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Get to your story!\\n\\nHERALD. All peoples are filled with admiration for your wisdom, and they\\naward you this golden crown.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I accept it. But tell me, why do the people admire me?\\n\\nHERALD. Oh you, who have founded so illustrious a city in the air, you\\nknow not in what esteem men hold you and how many there are who burn with\\ndesire to dwell in it. Before your city was built, all men had a mania\\nfor Sparta; long hair and fasting were held in honour, men went dirty\\nlike Socrates and carried staves. Now all is changed. Firstly, as soon as\\n\\'tis dawn, they all spring out of bed together to go and seek their food,\\nthe same as you do; then they fly off towards the notices and finally\\ndevour the decrees. The bird-madness is so clear, that many actually bear\\nthe names of birds. There is a halting victualler, who styles himself the\\npartridge; Menippus calls himself the swallow; Opontius the one-eyed\\ncrow; Philocles the lark; Theogenes the fox-goose; Lycurgus the ibis;\\nChaerephon the bat; Syracosius the magpie; Midias the quail;[325] indeed\\nhe looks like a quail that has been hit heavily over the head. Out of\\nlove for the birds they repeat all the songs which concern the swallow,\\nthe teal, the goose or the pigeon; in each verse you see wings, or at all\\nevents a few feathers. This is what is happening down there. Finally,\\nthere are more than ten thousand folk who are coming here from earth to\\nask you for feathers and hooked claws; so, mind you supply yourself with\\nwings for the immigrants.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah! by Zeus, \\'tis not the time for idling. Go as quick as\\npossible and fill every hamper, every basket you can find with wings.\\nManes[326] will bring them to me outside the walls, where I will welcome\\nthose who present themselves.\\n\\nCHORUS. This town will soon be inhabited by a crowd of men.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. If fortune favours us.\\n\\nCHORUS. Folk are more and more delighted with it.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Come, hurry up and bring them along.\\n\\nCHORUS. Will not man find here everything that can please him--wisdom,\\nlove, the divine Graces, the sweet face of gentle peace?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! you lazy servant! won\\'t you hurry yourself?\\n\\nCHORUS. Let a basket of wings be brought speedily. Come, beat him as I\\ndo, and put some life into him; he is as lazy as an ass.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Aye, Manes is a great craven.\\n\\nCHORUS. Begin by putting this heap of wings in order; divide them in\\nthree parts according to the birds from whom they came; the singing, the\\nprophetic[327] and the aquatic birds; then you must take care to\\ndistribute them to the men according to their character.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS (_to Manes_). Oh! by the kestrels! I can keep my hands off\\nyou no longer; you are too slow and lazy altogether.\\n\\nA PARRICIDE.[328] Oh! might I but become an eagle, who soars in the\\nskies! Oh! might I fly above the azure waves of the barren sea![329]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ha! \\'twould seem the news was true; I hear someone coming\\nwho talks of wings.\\n\\nPARRICIDE. Nothing is more charming than to fly; I burn with desire to\\nlive under the same laws as the birds; I am bird-mad and fly towards you,\\nfor I want to live with you and to obey your laws.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Which laws? The birds have many laws.\\n\\nPARRICIDE. All of them; but the one that pleases me most is, that among\\nthe birds it is considered a fine thing to peck and strangle one\\'s\\nfather.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Aye, by Zeus! according to us, he who dares to strike his\\nfather, while still a chick, is a brave fellow.\\n\\nPARRICIDE. And therefore I want to dwell here, for I want to strangle my\\nfather and inherit his wealth.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. But we have also an ancient law written in the code of the\\nstorks, which runs thus, \"When the stork father has reared his young and\\nhas taught them to fly, the young must in their turn support the father.\"\\n\\nPARRICIDE. \\'Tis hardly worth while coming all this distance to be\\ncompelled to keep my father!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. No, no, young friend, since you have come to us with such\\nwillingness, I am going to give you these black wings, as though you were\\nan orphan bird; furthermore, some good advice, that I received myself in\\ninfancy. Don\\'t strike your father, but take these wings in one hand and\\nthese spurs in the other; imagine you have a cock\\'s crest on your head\\nand go and mount guard and fight; live on your pay and respect your\\nfather\\'s life. You\\'re a gallant fellow! Very well, then! Fly to Thrace\\nand fight.[330]\\n\\nPARRICIDE. By Bacchus! \\'Tis well spoken; I will follow your counsel.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis acting wisely, by Zeus.\\n\\nCINESIAS.[331] \"On my light pinions I soar off to Olympus; in its\\ncapricious flight my Muse flutters along the thousand paths of poetry in\\nturn ...\"\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. This is a fellow will need a whole shipload of wings.\\n\\nCINESIAS. ... it is seeking fresh outlet.\"\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Welcome, Cinesias, you lime-wood man![332] Why have you\\ncome here a-twisting your game leg in circles?\\n\\nCINESIAS. \"I want to become a bird, a tuneful nightingale.\"\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Enough of that sort of ditty. Tell me what you want.\\n\\nCINESIAS. Give me wings and I will fly into the topmost airs to gather\\nfresh songs in the clouds, in the midst of the vapours and the fleecy\\nsnow.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Gather songs in the clouds?\\n\\nCINESIAS. \\'Tis on them the whole of our latter-day art depends. The most\\nbrilliant dithyrambs are those that flap their wings in void space and\\nare clothed in mist and dense obscurity. To appreciate this, just listen.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! no, no, no!\\n\\nCINESIAS. By Hermes! but indeed you shall. \"I shall travel through thine\\nethereal empire like a winged bird, who cleaveth space with his long\\nneck....\"\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Stop! easy all, I say![333]\\n\\nCINESIAS. ... as I soar over the seas, carried by the breath of the winds\\n...\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. By Zeus! but I\\'ll cut your breath short.\\n\\nCINESIAS. ... now rushing along the tracks of Notus, now nearing Boreas\\nacross the infinite wastes of the ether.\" (_Pisthetaerus beats him._) Ah!\\nold man, that\\'s a pretty and clever idea truly!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What! are you not delighted to be cleaving the air?[334]\\n\\nCINESIAS. To treat a dithyrambic poet, for whom the tribes dispute with\\neach other, in this style![335]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Will you stay with us and form a chorus of winged birds as\\nslender as Leotrophides[336] for the Cecropid tribe?\\n\\nCINESIAS. You are making game of me, \\'tis clear; but know that I shall\\nnever leave you in peace if I do not have wings wherewith to traverse the\\nair.\\n\\nAN INFORMER. What are these birds with downy feathers, who look so\\npitiable to me? Tell me, oh swallow with the long dappled wings.[337]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! but \\'tis a perfect invasion that threatens us. Here\\ncomes another of them, humming along.\\n\\nINFORMER. Swallow with the long dappled wings, once more I summon you.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. It\\'s his cloak I believe he\\'s addressing; \\'faith, it stands\\nin great need of the swallows\\' return.[338]\\n\\nINFORMER. Where is he who gives out wings to all comers?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis I, but you must tell me for what purpose you want\\nthem.\\n\\nINFORMER. Ask no questions. I want wings, and wings I must have.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Do you want to fly straight to Pellené?[339]\\n\\nINFORMER. I? Why, I am an accuser of the islands,[340] an informer ...\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. A fine trade, truly!\\n\\nINFORMER. ... a hatcher of lawsuits. Hence I have great need of wings to\\nprowl round the cities and drag them before justice.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Would you do this better if you had wings?\\n\\nINFORMER. No, but I should no longer fear the pirates; I should return\\nwith the cranes, loaded with a supply of lawsuits by way of ballast.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. So it seems, despite all your youthful vigour, you make it\\nyour trade to denounce strangers?\\n\\nINFORMER. Well, and why not? I don\\'t know how to dig.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. But, by Zeus! there are honest ways of gaining a living at\\nyour age without all this infamous trickery.\\n\\nINFORMER. My friend, I am asking you for wings, not for words.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis just my words that give you wings.\\n\\nINFORMER. And how can you give a man wings with your words?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. \\'Tis thus that all first start.\\n\\nINFORMER. All?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Have you not often heard the father say to young men in the\\nbarbers\\' shops, \"It\\'s astonishing how Diitrephes\\' advice has made my son\\nfly to horse-riding.\"--\"Mine,\" says another, \"has flown towards tragic\\npoetry on the wings of his imagination.\"\\n\\nINFORMER. So that words give wings?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Undoubtedly; words give wings to the mind and make a man\\nsoar to heaven. Thus I hope that my wise words will give you wings to fly\\nto some less degrading trade.\\n\\nINFORMER. But I do not want to.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What do you reckon on doing then?\\n\\nINFORMER. I won\\'t belie my breeding; from generation to generation we\\nhave lived by informing. Quick, therefore, give me quickly some light,\\nswift hawk or kestrel wings, so that I may summon the islanders, sustain\\nthe accusation here, and haste back there again on flying pinions.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I see. In this way the stranger will be condemned even\\nbefore he appears.\\n\\nINFORMER. That\\'s just it.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. And while he is on his way here by sea, you will be flying\\nto the islands to despoil him of his property.\\n\\nINFORMER. You\\'ve hit it, precisely; I must whirl hither and thither like\\na perfect humming-top.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I catch the idea. Wait, i\\' faith, I\\'ve got some fine\\nCorcyraean wings.[341] How do you like them?\\n\\nINFORMER. Oh! woe is me! Why, \\'tis a whip!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. No, no; these are the wings, I tell you, that set the top\\na-spinning.\\n\\nINFORMER. Oh! oh! oh!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Take your flight, clear off, you miserable cur, or you will\\nsoon see what comes of quibbling and lying. Come, let us gather up our\\nwings and withdraw.\\n\\nCHORUS. In my ethereal nights I have seen many things new and strange and\\nwondrous beyond belief. There is a tree called Cleonymus belonging to an\\nunknown species; it has no heart, is good for nothing and is as tall as\\nit is cowardly. In springtime it shoots forth calumnies instead of buds\\nand in autumn it strews the ground with bucklers in place of leaves.[342]\\n\\nFar away in the regions of darkness, where no ray of light ever enters,\\nthere is a country, where men sit at the table of the heroes and dwell\\nwith them always--save always in the evening. Should any mortal meet the\\nhero Orestes at night, he would soon be stripped and covered with blows\\nfrom head to foot.[343]\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Ah! by the gods! if only Zeus does not espy me! Where is\\nPisthetaerus?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ha! what is this? A masked man!\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Can you see any god behind me?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. No, none. But who are you, pray?\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. What\\'s the time, please?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. The time? Why, it\\'s past noon. Who are you?\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Is it the fall of day? Is it no later than that?[344]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! \\'pon my word! but you grow tiresome!\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. What is Zeus doing? Is he dispersing the clouds or gathering\\nthem?[345]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Take care, lest I lose all patience.\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Come, I will raise my mask.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah! my dear Prometheus!\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Stop! stop! speak lower!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Why, what\\'s the matter, Prometheus?\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. H\\'sh, h\\'sh! Don\\'t call me by my name; you will be my ruin, if\\nZeus should see me here. But, if you want me to tell you how things are\\ngoing in heaven, take this umbrella and shield me, so that the gods don\\'t\\nsee me.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I can recognize Prometheus in this cunning trick. Come,\\nquick then, and fear nothing; speak on.\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Then listen.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I am listening, proceed!\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. It\\'s all over with Zeus.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah! and since when, pray?\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Since you founded this city in the air. There is not a man\\nwho now sacrifices to the gods; the smoke of the victims no longer\\nreaches us. Not the smallest offering comes! We fast as though it were\\nthe festival of Demeter.[346] The barbarian gods, who are dying of\\nhunger, are bawling like Illyrians[347] and threaten to make an armed\\ndescent upon Zeus, if he does not open markets where joints of the\\nvictims are sold.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What! there are other gods besides you, barbarian gods who\\ndwell above Olympus?\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. If there were no barbarian gods, who would be the patron of\\nExecestides?[348]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. And what is the name of these gods?\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Their name? Why, the Triballi.[349]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah, indeed! \\'tis from that no doubt that we derive the word\\n\\'tribulation.\\'[350]\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Most likely. But one thing I can tell you for certain,\\nnamely, that Zeus and the celestial Triballi are going to send deputies\\nhere to sue for peace. Now don\\'t you treat, unless Zeus restores the\\nsceptre to the birds and gives you Basileia[351] in marriage.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Who is this Basileia?\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. A very fine young damsel, who makes the lightning for Zeus;\\nall things come from her, wisdom, good laws, virtue, the fleet,\\ncalumnies, the public paymaster and the triobolus.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah! then she is a sort of general manageress to the god.\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Yes, precisely. If he gives you her for your wife, yours will\\nbe the almighty power. That is what I have come to tell you; for you know\\nmy constant and habitual goodwill towards men.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh, yes! \\'tis thanks to you that we roast our meat.[352]\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. I hate the gods, as you know.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Aye, by Zeus, you have always detested them.\\n\\nPROMETHEUS. Towards them I am a veritable Timon;[353] but I must return\\nin all haste, so give me the umbrella; if Zeus should see me from up\\nthere, he would think I was escorting one of the Canephori.[354]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Wait, take this stool as well.\\n\\nCHORUS. Near by the land of the Sciapodes[355] there is a marsh, from the\\nborders whereof the odious Socrates evokes the souls of men.\\nPisander[356] came one day to see his soul, which he had left there when\\nstill alive. He offered a little victim, a camel,[357] slit his throat\\nand, following the example of Ulysses, stepped one pace backwards.[358]\\nThen that bat of a Chaerephon[359] came up from hell to drink the camel\\'s\\nblood.\\n\\nPOSIDON.[360] This is the city of Nephelococcygia, Cloud-cuckoo-town,\\nwhither we come as ambassadors. (_To Triballus_.) Hi! what are you up to?\\nyou are throwing your cloak over the left shoulder. Come, fling it quick\\nover the right! And why, pray, does it draggle this fashion? Have you\\nulcers to hide like Laespodias?[361] Oh! democracy![362] whither, oh!\\nwhither are you leading us? Is it possible that the gods have chosen such\\nan envoy?\\n\\nTRIBALLUS. Leave me alone.\\n\\nPOSIDON. Ugh! the cursed savage! you are by far the most barbarous of all\\nthe gods.--Tell me, Heracles, what are we going to do?\\n\\nHERACLES. I have already told you that I want to strangle the fellow who\\nhas dared to block us in.\\n\\nPOSIDON. But, my friend, we are envoys of peace.\\n\\nHERACLES. All the more reason why I wish to strangle him.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Hand me the cheese-grater; bring me the silphium for sauce;\\npass me the cheese and watch the coals.[363]\\n\\nHERACLES. Mortal! we who greet you are three gods.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Wait a bit till I have prepared my silphium pickle.\\n\\nHERACLES. What are these meats?[364]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. These are birds that have been punished with death for\\nattacking the people\\'s friends.\\n\\nHERACLES. And you are seasoning them before answering us?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah! Heracles! welcome, welcome! What\\'s the matter?[365]\\n\\nHERACLES. The gods have sent us here as ambassadors to treat for peace.\\n\\nA SERVANT. There\\'s no more oil in the flask.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. And yet the birds must be thoroughly basted with it.[366]\\n\\nHERACLES. We have no interest to serve in fighting you; as for you, be\\nfriends and we promise that you shall always have rain-water in your\\npools and the warmest of warm weather. So far as these points go we are\\narmed with plenary authority.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. We have never been the aggressors, and even now we are as\\nwell disposed for peace as yourselves, provided you agree to one\\nequitable condition, namely, that Zeus yield his sceptre to the birds. If\\nonly this is agreed to, I invite the ambassadors to dinner.\\n\\nHERACLES. That\\'s good enough for me. I vote for peace.\\n\\nPOSIDON. You wretch! you are nothing but a fool and a glutton. Do you\\nwant to dethrone your own father?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What an error! Why, the gods will be much more powerful if\\nthe birds govern the earth. At present the mortals are hidden beneath the\\nclouds, escape your observation, and commit perjury in your name; but if\\nyou had the birds for your allies, and a man, after having sworn by the\\ncrow and Zeus, should fail to keep his oath, the crow would dive down\\nupon him unawares and pluck out his eye.\\n\\nPOSIDON. Well thought of, by Posidon![367]\\n\\nHERACLES. My notion too.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. (_to the Triballian_). And you, what\\'s your opinion?\\n\\nTRIBALLUS. Nabaisatreu.[368]\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. D\\'you see? he also approves. But hear another thing in\\nwhich we can serve you. If a man vows to offer a sacrifice to some god\\nand then procrastinates, pretending that the gods can wait, and thus does\\nnot keep his word, we shall punish his stinginess.\\n\\nPOSIDON. Ah! ah! and how?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. While he is counting his money or is in the bath, a kite\\nwill relieve him, before he knows it, either in coin or in clothes, of\\nthe value of a couple of sheep, and carry it to the god.\\n\\nHERACLES. I vote for restoring them the sceptre.\\n\\nPOSIDON. Ask the Triballian.\\n\\nHERACLES. Hi! Triballian, do you want a thrashing?\\n\\nTRIBALLUS. Saunaka baktarikrousa.[368]\\n\\nHERACLES. He says, \"Right willingly.\"\\n\\nPOSIDON. If that be the opinion of both of you, why, I consent too.\\n\\nHERACLES. Very well! we accord the sceptre.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Ah! I was nearly forgetting another condition. I will leave\\nHeré to Zeus, but only if the young Basileia is given me in marriage.\\n\\nPOSIDON. Then you don\\'t want peace. Let us withdraw.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. It matters mighty little to me. Cook, look to the gravy.\\n\\nHERACLES. What an odd fellow this Posidon is! Where are you off to? Are\\nwe going to war about a woman?\\n\\nPOSIDON. What else is there to do?\\n\\nHERACLES. What else? Why, conclude peace.\\n\\nPOSIDON. Oh! the ninny! do you always want to be fooled? Why, you are\\nseeking your own downfall. If Zeus were to die, after having yielded them\\nthe sovereignty, you would be ruined, for you are the heir of all the\\nwealth he will leave behind.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Oh! by the gods! how he is cajoling you. Step aside, that I\\nmay have a word with you. Your uncle is getting the better of you, my\\npoor friend.[369] The law will not allow you an obolus of the paternal\\nproperty, for you are a bastard and not a legitimate child.\\n\\nHERACLES. I a bastard! What\\'s that you tell me?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Why, certainly; are you not born of a stranger woman?[370]\\nBesides, is not Athené recognized as Zeus\\' sole heiress? And no daughter\\nwould be that, if she had a legitimate brother.\\n\\nHERACLES. But what if my father wished to give me his property on his\\ndeath-bed, even though I be a bastard?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. The law forbids it, and this same Posidon would be the\\nfirst to lay claim to his wealth, in virtue of being his legitimate\\nbrother. Listen; thus runs Solon\\'s law: \"A bastard shall not inherit, if\\nthere are legitimate children; and if there are no legitimate children,\\nthe property shall pass to the nearest kin.\"\\n\\nHERACLES. And I get nothing whatever of the paternal property?\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Absolutely nothing. But tell me, has your father had you\\nentered on the registers of his phratria?[371]\\n\\nHERACLES. No, and I have long been surprised at the omission.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. What ails you, that you should shake your fist at heaven?\\nDo you want to fight it? Why, be on my side, I will make you a king and\\nwill feed you on bird\\'s milk and honey.\\n\\nHERACLES. Your further condition seems fair to me. I cede you the young\\ndamsel.\\n\\nPOSIDON. But I, I vote against this opinion.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Then all depends on the Triballian. (_To the Triballian._)\\nWhat do you say?\\n\\nTRIBALLUS. Big bird give daughter pretty and queen.\\n\\nHERACLES. You say that you give her?\\n\\nPOSIDON. Why no, he does not say anything of the sort, that he gives her;\\nelse I cannot understand any better than the swallows.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Exactly so. Does he not say she must be given to the\\nswallows?\\n\\nPOSIDON. Very well! you two arrange the matter; make peace, since you\\nwish it so; I\\'ll hold my tongue.\\n\\nHERACLES. We are of a mind to grant you all that you ask. But come up\\nthere with us to receive Basileia and the celestial bounty.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Here are birds already cut up, and very suitable for a\\nnuptial feast.\\n\\nHERACLES. You go and, if you like, I will stay here to roast them.\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. You to roast them! you are too much the glutton; come along\\nwith us.\\n\\nHERACLES. Ah! how well I would have treated myself!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Let some bring me a beautiful and magnificent tunic for the\\nwedding.\\n\\nCHORUS.[372] At Phanae,[373] near the Clepsydra,[374] there dwells a\\npeople who have neither faith nor law, the Englottogastors,[375] who\\nreap, sow, pluck the vines and the figs[376] with their tongues; they\\nbelong to a barbaric race, and among them the Philippi and the\\nGorgiases[377] are to be found; \\'tis these Englottogastorian Phillippi\\nwho introduced the custom all over Attica of cutting out the tongue\\nseparately at sacrifices.[378]\\n\\nA MESSENGER. Oh, you, whose unbounded happiness I cannot express in\\nwords, thrice happy race of airy birds, receive your king in your\\nfortunate dwellings. More brilliant than the brightest star that illumes\\nthe earth, he is approaching his glittering golden palace; the sun itself\\ndoes not shine with more dazzling glory. He is entering with his bride at\\nhis side[379] whose beauty no human tongue can express; in his hand he\\nbrandishes the lightning, the winged shaft of Zeus; perfumes of\\nunspeakable sweetness pervade the ethereal realms. \\'Tis a glorious\\nspectacle to see the clouds of incense wafting in light whirlwinds before\\nthe breath of the Zephyr! But here he is himself. Divine Muse! let thy\\nsacred lips begin with songs of happy omen.\\n\\nCHORUS. Fall back! to the right! to the left! advance![380] Fly around\\nthis happy mortal, whom Fortune loads with her blessings. Oh! oh! what\\ngrace! what beauty! Oh, marriage so auspicious for our city! All honour\\nto this man! \\'tis through him that the birds are called to such glorious\\ndestinies. Let your nuptial hymns, your nuptial songs, greet him and his\\nBasileia! \\'Twas in the midst of such festivities that the Fates formerly\\nunited Olympian Here to the King who governs the gods from the summit of\\nhis inaccessible throne. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus! Rosy Eros with the\\ngolden wings held the reins and guided the chariot; \\'twas he, who\\npresided over the union of Zeus and the fortunate Heré. Oh! Hymen! oh!\\nHymenaeus!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. I am delighted with your songs, I applaud your verses. Now\\ncelebrate the thunder that shakes the earth, the flaming lightning of\\nZeus and the terrible flashing thunderbolt.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh, thou golden flash of the lightning! oh, ye divine shafts of\\nflame, that Zeus has hitherto shot forth! Oh, ye rolling thunders, that\\nbring down the rain! \\'Tis by the order of our king that ye shall now\\nstagger the earth! Oh, Hymen! \\'tis through thee that he commands the\\nuniverse and that he makes Basileia, whom he has robbed from Zeus, take\\nher seat at his side. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\\n\\nPISTHETAERUS. Let all the winged tribes of our fellow-citizens follow the\\nbridal couple to the palace of Zeus[381] and to the nuptial couch!\\nStretch forth your hands, my dear wife! Take hold of me by my wings and\\nlet us dance; I am going to lift you up and carry you through the air.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh, joy! Io Paean!

Aye, certainly, any one you like, excepting \"I am worn out.\"\\nTake care you don\\'t say that, for it gets on my nerves.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Do you want some other drollery?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Yes, only not, \"I am quite broken up.\"\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Then what witty thing shall I say?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come, take courage; only ...\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Only what?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. ... don\\'t start saying as you shift your package from shoulder\\nto shoulder, \"Ah! that\\'s a relief!\"\\n\\nXANTHIAS. May I not at least say, that unless I am relieved of this\\ncursed load I shall let wind?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! for pity\\'s sake, no! you don\\'t want to make me spew.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What need then had I to take this luggage, if I must not copy\\nthe porters that Phrynichus, Lycis and Amipsias[382] never fail to put on\\nthe stage?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Do nothing of the kind. Whenever I chance to see one of these\\nstage tricks, I always leave the theatre feeling a good year older.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh! my poor back! you are broken and I am not allowed to make a\\nsingle joke.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Just mark the insolence of this Sybarite! I, Dionysus, the son\\nof a ... wine-jar,[383] I walk, I tire myself, and I set yonder rascal\\nupon an ass, that he may not have the burden of carrying his load.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. But am I not carrying it?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. No, since you are on your beast.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Nevertheless I am carrying this....\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. ... and it is very heavy.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. But this burden you carry is borne by the ass.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What I have here, \\'tis certainly I who bear it, and not the\\nass, no, by all the gods, most certainly not!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. How can you claim to be carrying it, when you are carried?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. That I can\\'t say; but this shoulder is broken, anyhow.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Well then, since you say that the ass is no good to you, pick\\nher up in your turn and carry her.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What a pity I did not fight at sea;[384] I would baste your\\nribs for that joke.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Dismount, you clown! Here is a door,[385] at which I want to\\nmake my first stop. Hi! slave! hi! hi! slave!\\n\\nHERACLES (_from inside the Temple_). Do you want to beat in the door? He\\nknocks like a Centaur.[386] Why, what\\'s the matter?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Xanthias!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Well?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Did you notice?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. How I frightened him?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Bah! you\\'re mad!\\n\\nHERACLES. Ho, by Demeter! I cannot help laughing; it\\'s no use biting my\\nlips, I must laugh.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come out, friend; I have need of you.\\n\\nHERACLES. Oh! \\'tis enough to make a fellow hold his sides to see this\\nlion\\'s-skin over a saffron robe![387] What does this mean? Buskins[388]\\nand a bludgeon! What connection have they? Where are you off to in this\\nrig?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. When I went aboard Clisthenes[389]....\\n\\nHERACLES. Did you fight?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. We sank twelve or thirteen ships of the enemy.\\n\\nHERACLES. You?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Aye, by Apollo!\\n\\nHERACLES. You have dreamt it.[390]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. As I was reading the \\'Andromeda\\'[391] on the ship, I suddenly\\nfelt my heart afire with a wish so violent....\\n\\nHERACLES. A wish! of what nature?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh, quite small, like Molon.[392]\\n\\nHERACLES. You wished for a woman?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. No.\\n\\nHERACLES. A young boy, then?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Nothing of the kind.\\n\\nHERACLES. A man?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Faugh!\\n\\nHERACLES. Might you then have had dealings with Clisthenes?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Have mercy, brother; no mockery! I am quite ill, so greatly\\ndoes my desire torment me!\\n\\nHERACLES. And what desire is it, little brother?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I cannot disclose it, but I will convey it to you by hints.\\nHave you ever been suddenly seized with a desire for pea-soup?\\n\\nHERACLES. For pea-soup! oh! oh! yes, a thousand times in my life.[393]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Do you take me or shall I explain myself in some other way?\\n\\nHERACLES. Oh! as far as the pea-soup is concerned, I understand\\nmarvellously well.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. So great is the desire, which devours me, for Euripides.\\n\\nHERACLES. But he is dead.[394]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. There is no human power can prevent my going to him.\\n\\nHERACLES. To the bottom of Hades?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Aye, and further than the bottom, an it need.\\n\\nHERACLES. And what do you want with him?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I want a master poet; \"some are dead and gone, and others are\\ngood for nothing.\"[395]\\n\\nHERACLES. Is Iophon[396] dead then?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. He is the only good one left me, and even of him I don\\'t know\\nquite what to think.\\n\\nHERACLES. Then there\\'s Sophocles, who is greater than Euripides; if you\\nmust absolutely bring someone back from Hades, why not make him live\\nagain?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. No, not until I have taken Iophon by himself and tested him for\\nwhat he is worth. Besides, Euripides is very artful and won\\'t leave a\\nstone unturned to get away with me, whereas Sophocles is as easy-going\\nwith Pluto as he was when on earth.\\n\\nHERACLES. And Agathon? Where is he?[397]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. He has left me; \\'twas a good poet and his friends regret him.\\n\\nHERACLES. And whither has the poor fellow gone?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. To the banquet of the blest.\\n\\nHERACLES. And Xenocles?[398]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. May the plague seize him!\\n\\nHERACLES. And Pythangelus?[399]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. They don\\'t say ever a word of poor me, whose shoulder is quite\\nshattered.\\n\\nHERACLES. Is there not a crowd of other little lads, who produce\\ntragedies by the thousand and are a thousand times more loquacious than\\nEuripides?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. They are little sapless twigs, chatterboxes, who twitter like\\nthe swallows, destroyers of the art, whose aptitude is withered with a\\nsingle piece and who sputter forth all their talent to the tragic Muse at\\ntheir first attempt. But look where you will, you will not find a\\ncreative poet who gives vent to a noble thought.\\n\\nHERACLES. How creative?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Aye, creative, who dares to risk \"the ethereal dwellings of\\nZeus,\" or \"the wing of Time,\" or \"a heart that is above swearing by the\\nsacred emblems,\" and \"a tongue that takes an oath, while yet the soul is\\nunpledged.\"[400]\\n\\nHERACLES. Is that the kind of thing that pleases you?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I\\'m more than madly fond of it.\\n\\nHERACLES. But such things are simply idiotic, you feel it yourself.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. \"Don\\'t come trespassing on my mind; you have a brain of your\\nown to keep thoughts in.\"[401]\\n\\nHERACLES. But nothing could be more detestable.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Where cookery is concerned, you can be my master.[402]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. They don\\'t say a thing about me!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. If I have decked myself out according to your pattern, \\'tis\\nthat you may tell me, in case I should need them, all about the hosts who\\nreceived you, when you journeyed to Cerberus; tell me of them as well as\\nof the harbours, the bakeries, the brothels, the drinking-shops, the\\nfountains, the roads, the eating-houses and of the hostels where there\\nare the fewest bugs.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. They never speak of me.[403]\\n\\nHERACLES. Go down to hell? Will you be ready to dare that, you madman?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Enough of that; but tell me the shortest road, that is neither\\ntoo hot nor too cold, to get down to Pluto.\\n\\nHERACLES. Let me see, what is the best road to show you? Aye, which? Ah!\\nthere\\'s the road of the gibbet and the rope. Go and hang yourself.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Be silent! your road is choking me.\\n\\nHERACLES. There is another path, both very short and well-trodden; the\\none that goes through the mortar.[404]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. \\'Tis hemlock you mean to say.\\n\\nHERACLES. Precisely so.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. That road is both cold and icy. Your legs get frozen at\\nonce.[405]\\n\\nHERACLES. Do you want me to tell you a very steep road, one that descends\\nvery quickly?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Ah! with all my heart; I don\\'t like long walks.\\n\\nHERACLES. Go to the Ceramicus.[406]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And then?\\n\\nHERACLES. Mount to the top of the highest tower ...\\n\\nDIONYSUS. To do what?\\n\\nHERACLES. ... and there keep your eye on the torch, which is to be the\\nsignal. When the spectators demand it to be flung, fling yourself ...\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Where?\\n\\nHERACLES. ... down.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. But I should break the two hemispheres of my brain. Thanks for\\nyour road, but I don\\'t want it.\\n\\nHERACLES. But which one then?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. The one you once travelled yourself.\\n\\nHERACLES. Ah! that\\'s a long journey. First you will reach the edge of the\\nvast, deep mere of Acheron.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And how is that to be crossed?\\n\\nHERACLES. There is an ancient ferryman, Charon by name, who will pass you\\nover in his little boat for a diobolus.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! what might the diobolus has everywhere! But however has it\\ngot as far as that?\\n\\nHERACLES. \\'Twas Theseus who introduced its vogue.[407] After that you\\nwill see snakes and all sorts of fearful monsters ...\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! don\\'t try to frighten me and make me afraid, for I am quite\\ndecided.\\n\\nHERACLES. ... then a great slough with an eternal stench, a veritable\\ncesspool, into which those are plunged who have wronged a guest, cheated\\na young boy out of the fee for his complaisance, beaten their mother,\\nboxed their father\\'s ears, taken a false oath or transcribed some tirade\\nof Morsimus.[408]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. For mercy\\'s sake, add likewise--or learnt the Pyrrhic dance of\\nCinesias.[409]\\n\\nHERACLES. Further on \\'twill be a gentle concert of flutes on every side,\\na brilliant light, just as there is here, myrtle groves, bands of happy\\nmen and women and noisy plaudits.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Who are these happy folk?\\n\\nHERACLES. The initiate.[410]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And I am the ass that carries the Mysteries;[411] but I\\'ve had\\nenough of it.\\n\\nHERACLES. They will give you all the information you will need, for they\\nlive close to Pluto\\'s palace, indeed on the road that leads to it.\\nFarewell, brother, and an agreeable journey to you. (_He returns into his\\nTemple._)\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And you, good health. Slave! take up your load again.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Before having laid it down?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And be quick about it too.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh, no, I adjure you! Rather hire one of the dead, who is going\\nto Hades.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And should I not find one....\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Then you can take me.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. You talk sense. Ah! here they are just bringing a dead man\\nalong. Hi! man, \\'tis you I\\'m addressing, you, dead fellow there! Will you\\ncarry a package to Pluto for me?\\n\\nDEAD MAN. Is\\'t very heavy?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. This. (_He shows him the baggage, which Xanthias has laid on\\nthe ground._)\\n\\nDEAD MAN. You will pay me two drachmae.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! that\\'s too dear.\\n\\nDEAD MAN. Well then, bearers, move on.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Stay, friend, so that I may bargain with you.\\n\\nDEAD MAN. Give me two drachmae, or it\\'s no deal.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Hold! here are nine obols.\\n\\nDEAD MAN. I would sooner go back to earth again.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Is that cursed rascal putting on airs? Come, then, I\\'ll go.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. You\\'re a good and noble fellow. Let us make the best of our way\\nto the boat.\\n\\nCHARON. Ahoy, ahoy! put ashore.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What\\'s that?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Why, by Zeus, \\'tis the mere of which Heracles spoke, and I see\\nthe boat.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Ah! there\\'s Charon.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Hail! Charon.\\n\\nDEAD MAN. Hail! Charon.\\n\\nCHARON. Who comes hither from the home of cares and misfortunes to rest\\non the banks of Lethé? Who comes to the ass\\'s fleece, who is for the land\\nof the Cerberians, or the crows, or Taenarus?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I am.\\n\\nCHARON. Get aboard quick then.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Where will you ferry me to? Where are you going to land me?\\n\\nCHARON. In hell, if you wish. But step in, do.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come here, slave.\\n\\nCHARON. I carry no slave, unless he has fought at sea to save his skin.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. But I could not, for my eyes were bad.\\n\\nCHARON. Well then! be off and walk round the mere.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Where shall I come to a halt?\\n\\nCHARON. At the stone of Auaenus, near the drinking-shop.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Do you understand?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Perfectly. Oh! unhappy wretch that I am, surely, surely I must\\nhave met something of evil omen as I came out of the house?[412]\\n\\nCHARON. Come, sit to your oar. If there be anyone else who wants to\\ncross, let him hurry. Hullo! what are you doing?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What am I doing? I am sitting on the oar[413] as you told me.\\n\\nCHARON. Will you please have the goodness to place yourself there,\\npot-belly?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. There.\\n\\nCHARON. Put out your hands, stretch your arms.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. There.\\n\\nCHARON. No tomfoolery! row hard, and put some heart into the work!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Row! and how can I? I, who have never set foot on a ship?\\n\\nCHARON. There\\'s nothing easier; and once you\\'re at work, you will hear\\nsome enchanting singers.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Who are they?\\n\\nCHARON. Frogs with the voices of swans; \\'tis most delightful.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come, set the stroke.\\n\\nCHARON. Yo ho! yo ho!\\n\\nFROGS. Brekekekex, coax, coax, brekekekekex, coax. Slimy offspring of the\\nmarshland, let our harmonious voices mingle with the sounds of the flute,\\ncoax, coax! let us repeat the songs that we sing in honour of the Nysaean\\nDionysus[414] on the day of the feast of pots,[415] when the drunken\\nthrong reels towards our temple in the Limnae.[416] Brekekekex, coax,\\ncoax.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I am beginning to feel my bottom getting very sore, my dear\\nlittle coax, coax.\\n\\nFROGS. Brekekekex, coax, coax.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. But doubtless you don\\'t care.\\n\\nFROGS. Brekekekex, coax, coax.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. May you perish with your coax, your endless coax!\\n\\nFROGS. And why change it, you great fool? I am beloved by the Muses with\\nthe melodious lyre, by the goat-footed Pan, who draws soft tones out of\\nhis reed; I am the delight of Apollo, the god of the lyre, because I make\\nthe rushes, which are used for the bridge of the lyre, grow in my\\nmarshes. Brekekekex, coax, coax.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I have got blisters and my behind is all of a sweat; by dint of\\nconstant movement, it will soon be saying....\\n\\nFROGS. Brekekekex, coax, coax.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come, race of croakers, be quiet.\\n\\nFROGS. Not we; we shall only cry the louder. On fine sunny days, it\\npleases us to hop through galingale and sedge and to sing while we swim;\\nand when Zeus is pouring down his rain, we join our lively voices to the\\nrustle of the drops. Brekekekex, coax, coax.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I forbid you to do it.\\n\\nFROGS. Oh! that would be too hard!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And is it not harder for me to wear myself out with rowing?\\n\\nFROGS. Brekekekex, coax, coax.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. May you perish! I don\\'t care.\\n\\nFROGS. And from morning till night we will shriek with the whole width of\\nour gullets, \"Brekekekex, coax, coax.\"\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I will cry louder than you all.\\n\\nFROGS. Oh! don\\'t do that!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh, yes, I will. I shall cry the whole day, if necessary, until\\nI no longer hear your coax. (_He begins to cry against the frogs, who\\nfinally stop._) Ah! I knew I would soon put an end to your coax.\\n\\nCHARON. Enough, enough, a last pull, ship oars, step ashore and pay your\\npassage money.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Look! here are my two obols.... Xanthias! where is Xanthias?\\nHi! Xanthias!\\n\\nXANTHIAS (_from a distance_). Hullo!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come here.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. I greet you, master.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What is there that way?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Darkness and mud!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Did you see the parricides and the perjured he told us of?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Did you?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Ha! by Posidon! I see some of them now.[417] Well, what are we\\ngoing to do?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. The best is to go on, for \\'tis here that the horrible monsters\\nare, Heracles told us of.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Ah! the wag! He spun yarns to frighten me, but I am a brave\\nfellow and he is jealous of me. There exists no greater braggart than\\nHeracles. Ah! I wish I might meet some monster, so as to distinguish\\nmyself by some deed of daring worthy of my daring journey.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Ah! hark! I hear a noise.\\n\\nDIONYSUS (_all of a tremble_). Where then, where?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Behind you.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Place yourself behind me.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Ah! \\'tis in front now.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Then pass to the front.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh! what a monster I can see!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What\\'s it like?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Dreadful, terrible! it assumes every shape; now \\'tis a bull,\\nthen a mule; again it is a most beautiful woman.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Where is she that I may run toward her?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. The monster is no longer a woman; \\'tis now a dog.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Then it is the Empusa.[418]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Its whole face is ablaze.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And it has a brazen leg?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Aye, i\\' faith! and the other is an ass\\'s leg,[419] rest well\\nassured of that.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Where shall I fly to?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And I?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Priest,[420] save me, that I may drink with you.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh! mighty Heracles! we are dead men.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Silence! I adjure you. Don\\'t utter that name.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Well then, we are dead men, Dionysus!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. That still less than the other.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Keep straight on, master, here, here, this way.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Well?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Be at ease, all goes well and we can say with Hegelochus,\\n\"After the storm, I see the return of the _cat_.\"[421] The Empusa has\\ngone.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Swear it to me.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. By Zeus!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Swear it again.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. By Zeus!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Once more.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. By Zeus!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! my god! how white I went at the sight of the Empusa! But\\nyonder fellow got red instead, so horribly afraid was he![422] Alas! to\\nwhom do I owe this terrible meeting? What god shall I accuse of having\\nsought my death? Might it be \"the Aether, the dwelling of Zeus,\" or \"the\\nwing of Time\"?[423]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Hist!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Don\\'t you hear?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What then?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. The sound of flutes.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Aye, certainly, and the wind wafts a smell of torches hither,\\nwhich bespeaks the Mysteries a league away. But make no noise; let us\\nhide ourselves and listen.\\n\\nCHORUS.[424] Iacchus, oh! Iacchus! Iacchus, oh! Iacchus!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Master, these are the initiates, of whom Heracles spoke and who\\nare here at their sports; they are incessantly singing of Iacchus, just\\nlike Diagoras.[425]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I believe you are right, but \\'tis best to keep ourselves quiet\\ntill we get better information.\\n\\nCHORUS. Iacchus, venerated god, hasten at our call. Iacchus, oh! Iacchus!\\ncome into this meadow, thy favourite resting-place; come to direct the\\nsacred choirs of the Initiate; may a thick crown of fruit-laden myrtle\\nbranches rest on thy head and may thy bold foot step this free and joyful\\ndance, taught us by the Graces--this pure, religious measure, that our\\nsacred choirs rehearse.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh! thou daughter of Demeter, both mighty and revered, what a\\ndelicious odour of pork!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Cannot you keep still then, fellow, once you get a whiff of a\\nbit of tripe?\\n\\nCHORUS. Brandish the flaming torches and so revive their brilliancy.\\nIacchus, oh! Iacchus! bright luminary of our nocturnal Mysteries. The\\nmeadow sparkles with a thousand fires; the aged shake off the weight of\\ncares and years; they have once more found limbs of steel, wherewith to\\ntake part in thy sacred measures; and do thou, blessed deity, lead the\\ndances of youth upon this dewy carpet of flowers with a torch in thine\\nhand.\\n\\nSilence, make way for our choirs, you profane and impure souls, who have\\nneither been present at the festivals of the noble Muses, nor ever footed\\na dance in their honour, and who are not initiated into the mysterious\\nlanguage of the dithyrambs of the voracious Cratinus;[426] away from here\\nhe who applauds misplaced buffoonery. Away from here the bad citizen, who\\nfor his private ends fans and nurses the flame of sedition, the chief who\\nsells himself, when his country is weathering the storms, and surrenders\\neither fortresses or ships; who, like Thorycion,[427] the wretched\\ncollector of tolls, sends prohibited goods from Aegina to Epidaurus, such\\nas oar-leathers, sailcloth and pitch, and who secures a subsidy for a\\nhostile fleet,[428] or soils the statues of Hecaté,[429] while he is\\nhumming some dithyramb. Away from here, the orator who nibbles at the\\nsalary of the poets, because he has been scouted in the ancient\\nsolemnities of Dionysus; to all such I say, and I repeat, and I say it\\nagain for the third time, \"Make way for the choruses of the Initiate.\"\\nBut you, raise you your voice anew; resume your nocturnal hymns as it is\\nmeet to do at this festival.\\n\\nLet each one advance boldly into the retreats of our flowery meads, let\\nhim mingle in our dances, let him give vent to jesting, to wit and to\\nsatire. Enough of junketing, lead forward! let our voices praise the\\ndivine protectress[430] with ardent love, yea! praise her, who promises\\nto assure the welfare of this country for ever, in spite of Thorycion.\\n\\nLet our hymns now be addressed to Demeter, the Queen of Harvest, the\\ngoddess crowned with ears of corn; to her be dedicated the strains of our\\ndivine concerts. Oh! Demeter, who presidest over the pure mysteries, help\\nus and protect thy choruses; far from all danger, may I continually yield\\nmyself to sports and dancing, mingle laughter with seriousness, as is\\nfitting at thy festivals, and as the reward for my biting sarcasms may I\\nwreathe my head with the triumphal fillets. And now let our songs summon\\nhither the lovable goddess, who so often joins in our dances.\\n\\nOh, venerated Dionysus, who hast created such soft melodies for this\\nfestival, come to accompany us to the goddess, show that you can traverse\\na long journey without wearying.[431] Dionysus, the king of the dance,\\nguide my steps. \\'Tis thou who, to raise a laugh and for the sake of\\neconomy,[432] hast torn our sandals and our garments; let us bound, let\\nus dance at our pleasure, for we have nothing to spoil. Dionysus, king of\\nthe dance, guide my steps. Just now I saw through a corner of my eye a\\nravishing young girl, the companion of our sports; I saw the nipple of\\nher bosom peeping through a rent in her tunic. Dionysus, king of the\\ndance, guide my steps.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Aye, I like to mingle with these choruses; I would fain dance\\nand sport with that young girl.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And I too.\\n\\nCHORUS. Would you like us to mock together at Archidemus? He is still\\nawaiting his seven-year teeth to have himself entered as a citizen;[433]\\nbut he is none the less a chief of the people among the Athenians and the\\ngreatest rascal of \\'em all. I am told that Clisthenes is tearing the hair\\nout of his rump and lacerating his cheeks on the tomb of Sebinus, the\\nAnaphlystian;[434] with his forehead against the ground, he is beating\\nhis bosom and groaning and calling him by name. As for Callias,[435] the\\nillustrious son of Hippobinus, the new Heracles, he is fighting a\\nterrible battle of love on his galleys; dressed up in a lion\\'s skin, he\\nfights a fierce naval battle--with the girls\\' cunts.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Could you tell us where Pluto dwells? We are strangers and have\\njust arrived.\\n\\nCHORUS. Go no farther, and know without further question that you are at\\nhis gates.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Slave, pick up your baggage.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. This wretched baggage, \\'tis like Corinth, the daughter of Zeus,\\nfor it\\'s always in his mouth.[436]\\n\\nCHORUS. And now do ye, who take part in this religious festival, dance a\\ngladsome round in the flowery grove in honour of the goddess.[437]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. As for myself, I will go with the young girls and the women\\ninto the enclosure, where the nocturnal ceremonies are held; \\'tis I will\\nbear the sacred torch.\\n\\nCHORUS. Let us go into the meadows, that are sprinkled with roses, to\\nform, according to our rites, the graceful choirs, over which the blessed\\nFates preside. \\'Tis for us alone that the sun doth shine; his glorious\\nrays illumine the Initiate, who have led the pious life, that is equally\\ndear to strangers and citizens.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come now! how should we knock at this door? How do the dwellers\\nin these parts knock?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Lose no time and attack the door with vigour, if you have the\\ncourage of Heracles as well as his costume.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Ho! there! Slave!\\n\\nAEACUS. Who\\'s there?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Heracles, the bold.\\n\\nAEACUS. Ah! wretched, impudent, shameless, threefold rascal, the most\\nrascally of rascals. Ah! \\'tis you who hunted out our dog Cerberus, whose\\nkeeper I was! But I have got you to-day; and the black stones of Styx,\\nthe rocks of Acheron, from which the blood is dripping, and the roaming\\ndogs of Cocytus shall account to me for you; the hundred-headed Hydra\\nshall tear your sides to pieces; the Tartessian Muraena[438] shall fasten\\nitself on your lungs and the Tithrasian[439] Gorgons shall tear your\\nkidneys and your gory entrails to shreds; I will go and fetch them as\\nquickly as possible.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Eh! what are you doing there?\\n\\nDIONYSUS (_stooping down_). I have just shit myself! Invoke the god.[440]\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Get up at once. How a stranger would laugh, if he saw you.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Ah! I\\'m fainting. Place a sponge on my heart.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Here, take it.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Place it yourself.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. But where? Good gods, where _is_ your heart?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. It has sunk into my shoes with fear. (_Takes his slave\\'s hand\\nholding the sponge, and applies it to his bottom._)\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh! you most cowardly of gods and men!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What! I cowardly? I, who have asked you for a sponge! \\'Tis what\\nno one else would have done.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. How so?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. A poltroon would have fallen backwards, being overcome with the\\nfumes; as for me, I got up and moreover I wiped myself clean.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Ah! by Posidon! a wonderful feat of intrepidity!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Aye, certainly. And you did not tremble at the sound of his\\nthreatening words?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. They never troubled me.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Well then, since you are so brave and fearless, become what I\\nam, take this bludgeon and this lion\\'s hide, you, whose heart has no\\nknowledge of fear; I, in return, will carry the baggage.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Here, take it, take it quick! \\'this my duty to obey you, and\\nbehold, Heracles-Xanthias! Do I look like a coward of your kidney?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. No. You are the exact image of the god of Melité,[441] dressed\\nup as a rascal. Come, I will take the baggage.\\n\\nFEMALE ATTENDANT OF PERSEPHONÉ. Ah! is it you then, beloved Heracles?\\nCome in. As soon as ever the goddess, my mistress Persephoné, knew of\\nyour arrival, she quickly had the bread into the oven and clapped two or\\nthree pots of bruised peas upon the fire; she has had a whole bullock\\nroasted and both cakes and rolled backed. Come in quick!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. No, thank you.\\n\\nATTENDANT. Oh! by Apollo! I shall not let you off. She has also had\\npoultry boiled for you, sweetmeats makes, and has prepared you some\\ndelicious wine. Come then, enter with me.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. I am much obliged.\\n\\nATTENDANT. Are you mad? I will not let you go. There is likewise and\\nenchanted flute-girl specially for you, and two or three dancing wenches.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What do you say? Dancing wenches?\\n\\nATTENDANT. In the prime of their life and all freshly depilated. Come,\\nenter, for the cook was going to take the fish off the fire and the table\\nwas being spread.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Very well then! Run in quickly and tell the dancing-girls I am\\ncoming. Slave! pick up the baggage and follow me.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Not so fast! Oh! indeed! I disguise you as Heracles for a joke\\nand you take the thing seriously! None of your nonsense, Xanthias! Take\\nback the baggage.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What? You are not thinking of taking back what you gave me\\nyourself?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. No, I don\\'t think about it; I do it. Off with that skin!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Witness how i am treated, ye great dogs, and be my judges!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What gods? Are you so stupid, such a fool? How can you, a slave\\nand a mortal, be the son of Alcmena?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Come then! \\'tis well! take them. But perhaps you will be\\nneeding me one day, an it please the gods.\\n\\nCHORUS. \\'Tis the act of a wise and sensible man, who has done much\\nsailing, always to trim his sail towards the quarter whence the fair wind\\nwafts, rather than stand stiff and motionless like a god Terminus.[442]\\nTo change your part to serve your own interest is to act like a clever\\nman, a true Theramenes.[443]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Faith! \\'twould be funny indeed if Xanthias, a slave, were\\nindolently stretched out on purple cushions and fucking the dancing-girl;\\nif he were then to ask me for a pot, while I, looking on, would be\\nrubbing my tool, and this master rogue, on seeing it, were to know out my\\nfront teeth with a blow of his fist.\\n\\nFIRST INKEEPER\\'S WIFE. Here! Plathané, Plathané! do come! here is the\\nrascal who once came into our shop and ate up sixteen loaves for us.\\n\\nSECOND INKEEPER\\'S WIFE. Aye, truly, \\'tis he himself!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. This is turning out rough for somebody.\\n\\nFIRST WIFE. And besides that, twenty pieces of boiled meat at half an\\nobolus apiece.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. There\\'s someone going to get punished.\\n\\nFIRST WIFE. And I don\\'t know how many cloves of garlic.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. You are rambling, my dear, you don\\'t know what you are saying.\\n\\nFIRST WIFE. Hah! you thought I should not know you, because of your\\nbuskins! And then all the salt fish, I had forgotten that!\\n\\nSECOND WIFE. And then, alas! the fresh cheese that he devoured, osier\\nbaskets and all! Ten, when I asked for my money, he started to roar and\\nshoot terrible looks at me.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. As! I recognize him well by that token; \\'tis just his way.\\n\\nSECOND WIFE. And he drew out his sword like a madman.\\n\\nFIRST WIFE. By the gods, yes.\\n\\nSECOND WIFE. Terrified to death, we clambered up to the upper storey, and\\nhe fled at top speed, carrying off our baskets with him.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Ah! this is again his style! But you ought to take action.\\n\\nFIRST WIFE. Run quick and call Cleon, my patron.\\n\\nSECOND WIFE. And you, should you run against Hyperbolus,[444] bring him\\nto me; we will knock the life out of our robber.\\n\\nFIRST WIFE. Oh! you miserable glutton! how I should delight in breaking\\nthose grinders of yours, which devoured my goods!\\n\\nSECOND WIFE. And I in hurling you into the malefactor\\'s pit.\\n\\nFIRST WIFE. And I in slitting with one stroke of the sickle that gullet\\nthat bolted down the tripe. But I am going to fetch Cleon; he shall\\nsummon you before the court this very day and force you to disgorge.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. May I die, if Xanthias is not my dearest friend.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Can I be the son of Alcmena, I, a slave and a mortal?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I know, I know, that you are in a fury and you have the right\\nto be; you can even beat me and I will not reply. But if I ever take this\\ncostume from you again, may I die of the most fearful torture--I, my\\nwife, my children, all those who belong to me, down to the very last, and\\nblear-eyed Archidemus[445] into the bargain.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. I accept your oath, and on those terms I agree.\\n\\nCHORUS. \\'Tis now your cue, since you have resumed the dress, to act the\\nbrave and to throw terror into your glance, thus recalling the god whom\\nyou represent. But if you play your part badly, if you yield to any\\nweakness, you will again have to load your shoulders with the baggage.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Friends, your advice is good, but I was thinking the same\\nmyself; if there is any good to be got, my master will again want to\\ndespoil me of this costume, of that I am quite certain. Ne\\'ertheless, I\\nam going to show a fearless heart and shoot forth ferocious looks. And\\nlo! the time for it has come, for I hear a noise at the door.\\n\\nAEACUS (_to his slaves_). Bind me this dog-thief,[446] that he may be\\npunished. Hurry yourselves, hurry!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. This is going to turn out badly for someone.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Look to yourselves and don\\'t come near me.\\n\\nAEACUS. Hah! you would show fight! Ditylas, Sceblyas, Pardocas,[447] come\\nhere and have at him!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Ah! you would strike him because he has stolen!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. \\'Tis horrible!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. \\'Tis a revolting cruelty!\\n\\nXANTHIAS. By Zeus! may I die, if I ever came here or stole from you the\\nvalue of a pin!  But I will act nobly; take this slave, put him to the\\nquestion, and if you obtain the proof of my guilt, put me to death.\\n\\nAEACUS. In what manner shall I put him to the question?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. In every manner; you may lash him to the wooden horse, hang\\nhim, cut him open with scourging, flay him, twist his limbs, pour vinegar\\ndown his nostrils, load him with bricks, anything you like; only don\\'t\\nbeat him with leeks or fresh garlic.[448]\\n\\nAEACUS. \\'Tis well conceived; but if the blows maim your slave, you will\\nbe claiming damages from me.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. No, certainly not! set about putting him to the question.\\n\\nAEACUS. It shall be done here, for I wish him to speak in your presence.\\nCome, put down your pack, and be careful not to lie.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I forbid you to torture me, for I am immortal; if you dare it,\\nwoe to you!\\n\\nAEACUS. What say you?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I say that I am an immortal, Dionysus, the son of Zeus, and\\nthat this fellow is only a slave.\\n\\nAEACUS (_to Xanthias_). D\\'you hear him?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Yes. \\'Tis all the better reason for beating him with rods, for,\\nif he is a god, he will not feel the blows.\\n\\nDIONYSUS (_to Xanthias_).\\n\\nBut why, pray, since you also claim to be a god, should you not be beaten\\nlike myself?\\n\\nXANTHIAS (_to Aeacus_).\\n\\nThat\\'s fair. Very well then, whichever of us two you first see crying and\\ncaring for the blows, him believe not to be a god.\\n\\n\\nAEACUS. \\'Tis spoken like a brave fellow; you don\\'t refuse what is right.\\nStrip yourselves.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. To do the thing fairly, how do you propose to act?\\n\\nAEACUS. Oh! that\\'s easy. I shall hit you one after the other.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Well thought of.\\n\\nAEACUS. There! (_He strikes Xanthias_.)\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Watch if you see me flinch.\\n\\nAEACUS. I have already struck you.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. No, you haven\\'t.\\n\\nAEACUS. Why, you have not felt it at all, I think. Now for t\\'other one.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Be quick about it.\\n\\nAEACUS. But I have struck you.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Ah! I did not even sneeze. How is that?\\n\\nAEACUS. I don\\'t know; come, I will return to the first one.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Get it over. Oh, oh!\\n\\nAEACUS. What does that \"oh, oh!\" mean? Did it hurt you?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh, no! but I was thinking of the feasts of Heracles, which are\\nbeing held at Diomeia.[449]\\n\\nAEACUS. Oh! what a pious fellow! I pass on to the other again.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! oh!\\n\\nAEACUS. What\\'s wrong?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I see some knights.[450]\\n\\nAEACUS. Why are you weeping?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Because I can smell onions.\\n\\nAEACUS. Ha! so you don\\'t care a fig for the blows?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Not the least bit in the world.\\n\\nAEACUS. Well, let us proceed. Your turn now.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Oh, I say!\\n\\nAEACUS. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Pull out this thorn.[451]\\n\\nAEACUS. What? Now the other one again.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. \"Oh, Apollo!... King of Delos and Delphi!\"\\n\\nXANTHIAS. He felt that. Do you hear?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Why, no! I was quoting an iambic of Hipponax.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. \\'Tis labour in vain. Come, smite his flanks.\\n\\nAEACUS. No, present your belly.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh, Posidon ...\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Ah! here\\'s someone who\\'s feeling it.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. ... who reignest on the Aegean headland and in the depths of\\nthe azure sea.[452]\\n\\nAEACUS. By Demeter, I cannot find out which of you is the god. But come\\nin; the master and Persephoné will soon tell you, for they are gods\\nthemselves.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. You are quite right; but you should have thought of that before\\nyou beat us.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! Muse, take part in our sacred choruses; our songs will\\nenchant you and you shall see a people of wise men, eager for a nobler\\nglory than that of Cleophon,[453] the braggart, the swallow, who deafens\\nus with his hoarse cries, while perched upon a Thracian tree. He whines\\nin his barbarian tongue and repeats the lament of Philomela with good\\nreason, for even if the votes were equally divided, he would have to\\nperish.[454]\\n\\nThe sacred chorus owes the city its opinion and its wise lessons. First I\\ndemand that equality be restored among the citizens, so that none may be\\ndisquieted. If there be any whom the artifices of Phrynichus have drawn\\ninto any error,[455] let us allow them to offer their excuses and let us\\nforget these old mistakes. Furthermore, that there be not a single\\ncitizen in Athens who is deprived of his rights; otherwise would it not\\nbe shameful to see slaves become masters and treated as honourably as\\nPlataeans, because they helped in a single naval fight?[456] Not that I\\ncensure this step, for, on the contrary I approve it; \\'tis the sole thing\\nyou have done that is sensible. But those citizens, both they and their\\nfathers, have so often fought with you and are allied to you by ties of\\nblood, so ought you not to listen to their prayers and pardon them their\\nsingle fault? Nature has given you wisdom, therefore let your anger cool\\nand let all those who have fought together on Athenian galleys live in\\nbrotherhood and as fellow-citizens, enjoying the same equal rights; to\\nshow ourselves proud and intractable about granting the rights of the\\ncity, especially at a time when we are riding at the mercy of the\\nwaves,[457] is a folly, of which we shall later repent.\\n\\nIf I am adept at reading the destiny or the soul of a man, the fatal hour\\nfor little Cligenes[458] is near, that unbearable ape, the greatest rogue\\nof all the washermen, who use a mixture of ashes and Cimolian earth and\\ncall it potash.[458] He knows it; hence he is always armed for war; for\\nhe fears, if he ventures forth without his bludgeon, he would be stripped\\nof his clothes when he is drunk.\\n\\nI have often noticed that there are good and honest citizens in Athens,\\nwho are as old gold is to new money. The ancient coins are excellent in\\npoint of standard; they are assuredly the best of all moneys; they alone\\nare well struck and give a pure ring; everywhere they obtain currency,\\nboth in Greece and in strange lands; yet we make no use of them and\\nprefer those bad copper pieces quite recently issued and so wretchedly\\nstruck. Exactly in the same way do we deal with our citizens. If we know\\nthem to be well-born, sober, brave, honest, adepts in the exercises of\\nthe gymnasium and in the liberal arts, they are the butts of our\\ncontumely and we have only a use for the petty rubbish, consisting of\\nstrangers, slaves and low-born folk not worth a whit more, mushrooms of\\nyesterday, whom formerly Athens would not have even wanted as scapegoats.\\nMadmen, do change your ways at last; employ the honest men afresh; if you\\nare fortunate through doing this, \\'twill be but right, and if Fate\\nbetrays you, the wise will at least praise you for having fallen\\nhonourably.\\n\\nAEACUS. By Zeus, the Deliverer! what a brave man your master is.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. A brave man! I should think so indeed, for he only knows how to\\ndrink and to make love!\\n\\nAEACUS. He has convicted you of lying and did not thrash the impudent\\nrascal who had dared to call himself the master.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Ah! he would have rued it if he had.\\n\\nAEACUS. Well spoken! that\\'s a reply that does a slave credit; \\'tis thus\\nthat I like to act too.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. How, pray?\\n\\nAEACUS. I am beside myself with joy, when I can curse my master in\\nsecret.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And when you go off grumbling, after having been well thrashed?\\n\\nAEACUS. I am delighted.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And when you make yourself important?\\n\\nAEACUS. I know of nothing sweeter.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. Ah! by Zeus! we are brothers. And when you are listening to\\nwhat your masters are saying?\\n\\nAEACUS. \\'Tis a pleasure that drives me to distraction.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And when you repeat it to strangers?\\n\\nAEACUS. Oh! I feel as happy as if I were emitting semen.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. By Phoebus Apollo! reach me your hand; come hither, that I may\\nembrace you; and, in the name of Zeus, the Thrashed one, tell me what all\\nthis noise means, these shouts, these quarrels, that I can hear going on\\ninside yonder.\\n\\nAEACUS. \\'Tis Aeschylus and Euripides.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What do you mean?\\n\\nAEACUS. The matter is serious, very serious indeed; all Hades is in\\ncommotion.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What\\'s it all about?\\n\\nAEACUS. We have a law here, according to which, whoever in each of the\\ngreat sciences and liberal arts beats all his rivals, is fed at the\\nPrytaneum and sits at Pluto\\'s side ...\\n\\nXANTHIAS. I know that.\\n\\nAEACUS. ... until someone cleverer than he in the same style of thing\\ncomes along; then he has to give way to him.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And how has this law disturbed Aeschylus?\\n\\nAEACUS. He held the chair for tragedy, as being the greatest in his art.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And who has it now?\\n\\nAEACUS. When Euripides descended here, he started reciting his verses to\\nthe cheats, cut-purses, parricides, and brigands, who abound in Hades;\\nhis supple and tortuous reasonings filled them with enthusiasm, and they\\npronounced him the cleverest by far. So Euripides, elated with pride,\\ntook possession of the throne on which Aeschylus was installed.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And did he not get stoned?\\n\\nAEACUS. No, but the folk demanded loudly that a regular trial should\\ndecide to which of the two the highest place belonged.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What folk? this mob of rascals? (_Points to the spectators._)\\n\\nAEACUS. Their clamour reached right up to heaven.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And had Aeschylus not his friends too?\\n\\nAEACUS. Good people are very scarce here, just the same as on earth.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What does Pluto reckon to do?\\n\\nAEACUS. To open a contest as soon as possible; the two rivals will show\\ntheir skill, and finally a verdict will be given.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What! has not Sophocles also claimed the chair then?\\n\\nAEACUS. No, no! he embraced Aeschylus and shook his hand, when he came\\ndown; he could have taken the seat, for Aeschylus vacated it for him; but\\naccording to Clidemides,[459] he prefers to act as his second; if\\nAeschylus triumphs, he will stay modestly where he is, but if not, he has\\ndeclared that he will contest the prize with Euripides.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. When is the contest to begin?\\n\\nAEACUS. Directly! the battle royal is to take place on this very spot.\\nPoetry is to be weighed in the scales.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. What? How can tragedy be weighed?\\n\\nAEACUS. They will bring rulers and compasses to measure the words, and\\nthose forms which are used for moulding bricks, also diameter measures\\nand wedges, for Euripides says he wishes to torture every verse of his\\nrival\\'s tragedies.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. If I mistake not, Aeschylus must be in a rage.\\n\\nAEACUS. With lowered head he glares fiercely like a bull.\\n\\nXANTHIAS. And who will be the judge?\\n\\nAEACUS. The choice was difficult; it was seen that there was a dearth of\\nable men. Aeschylus took exception to the Athenians ...\\n\\nXANTHIAS. No doubt he thought there were too many thieves among them.\\n\\nAEACUS. ... and moreover believed them too light-minded to judge of a\\npoet\\'s merits. Finally they fell back upon your master, because he\\nunderstands tragic poetry.[460] But let us go in; when the masters are\\nbusy, we must look out for blows!\\n\\nCHORUS. Ah! what fearful wrath will be surging in his heart! what a roar\\nthere\\'ll be when he sees the babbler who challenges him sharpening his\\nteeth! how savagely his eyes will roll! What a battle of words like\\nplumed helmets and waving crests hurling themselves against fragile\\noutbursts and wretched parings! We shall see the ingenious architect of\\nstyle defending himself against immense periods. Then, the close hairs of\\nhis thick mane all a-bristle, the giant will knit his terrible brow; he\\nwill pull out verses as solidly bolted together as the framework of a\\nship and will hurl them forth with a roar, while the pretty speaker with\\nthe supple and sharpened tongue, who weighs each syllable and submits\\neverything to the lash of his envy, will cut this grand style to\\nmincemeat and reduce to ruins this edifice erected by one good sturdy\\npuff of breath.[461]\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_to Dionysus_). Your advice is in vain, I shall not vacate the\\nchair, for I contend I am superior to him.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Aeschylus, why do you keep silent? You understand what he says.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. He is going to stand on his dignity first; \\'tis a trick he\\nnever failed to use in his tragedies.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. My dear fellow, a little less arrogance, please.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Oh! I know him for many a day. I have long had a thorough hold\\nof his ferocious heroes, for his high-flown language and of the monstrous\\nblustering words which his great, gaping mouth hurls forth thick and\\nclose without curb or measure.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. It is indeed you, the son of a rustic goddess,[462] who dare\\nto treat me thus, you, who only know how to collect together stupid\\nsayings and to stitch the rags of your beggars?[463] I shall make you rue\\nyour insults.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Enough said, Aeschylus, calm the wild wrath that is turning\\nyour heart into a furnace.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. No, not until I have clearly shown the true value of this\\nimpudent fellow with his lame men.[464]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. A lamb, a black lamb! Slaves, bring it quickly, the storm-cloud\\nis about to burst.[465]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Shame on your Cretan monologues![466] Shame on the infamous\\nnuptials[467] that you introduce into the tragic art!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Curb yourself, noble Aeschylus, and as for you, my poor\\nEuripides, be prudent, protect yourself from this hailstorm, or he may\\neasily in his rage hit you full in the temple with some terrible word,\\nthat would let out your Telephus.[468] Come, Aeschylus, no flying into a\\ntemper! discuss the question coolly; poets must not revile each other\\nlike market wenches. Why, you shout at the very outset and burst out like\\na pine that catches fire in the forest.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I am ready for the contest and don\\'t flinch; let him choose\\nthe attack or the defence; let him discuss everything, the dialogue, the\\nchoruses, the tragic genius, Peleus, Aeolus, Meleager[469] and especially\\nTelephus.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And what do you propose to do, Aeschylus? Speak!\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. I should have wished not to maintain a contest that is not\\nequal or fair.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Why not fair?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Because my poetry has outlived me, whilst his died with him\\nand he can use it against me. However, I submit to your ruling.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Let incense and a brazier be brought, for I want to offer a\\nprayer to the gods. Thanks to their favour, may I be able to decide\\nbetween these ingenious rivals as a clever expert should! And do you sing\\na hymn in honour of the Muses.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! ye chaste Muses, the daughters of Zeus, you who read the fine\\nand subtle minds of thought-makers when they enter upon a contest of\\nquibbles and tricks, look down on these two powerful athletes; inspire\\nthem, one with mighty words and the other with odds and ends of verses.\\nNow the great mind contest is beginning.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And do you likewise make supplication to the gods before\\nentering the lists.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Oh, Demeter! who hast formed my mind, may I be able to prove\\nmyself worthy of thy Mysteries![470]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And you, Euripides, prove yourself meet to sprinkle incense on\\nthe brazier.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Thanks, but I sacrifice to other gods.[471]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. To private gods of your own, which you have made after your own\\nimage?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Why, certainly!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Well then, invoke your gods.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Oh! thou Aether, on which I feed, oh! thou Volubility of\\nSpeech, oh! Craftiness, oh! Subtle Scent! enable me to crush the\\narguments of my opponent.\\n\\nCHORUS. We are curious to see upon what ground these clever tilters are\\ngoing to measure each other. Their tongue is keen, their wit is ready,\\ntheir heart is full of audacity. From the one we must expect both\\nelegance and polish of language, whereas the other, armed with his\\nponderous words, will fall hip and thigh upon his foe and with a single\\nblow tear down and scatter all his vain devices.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come, be quick and speak and let your words be elegant, but\\nwithout false imagery or platitude.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I shall speak later of my poetry, but I want first to prove\\nthat Aeschylus is merely a wretched impostor; I shall relate by what\\nmeans he tricked a coarse audience, trained in the school of\\nPhrynichus.[472] First one saw some seated figure, who was veiled, some\\nAchilles or Niobé,[473] who then strutted about the stage, but neither\\nuncovered their face nor uttered a syllable.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I\\' faith!  that\\'s true!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Meanwhile, the Chorus would pour forth as many as four tirades\\none after the other, without stopping, and the characters would still\\nmaintain their stony silence.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I liked their silence, and these mutes pleased me no less than\\nthose characters that have such a heap to say nowadays.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \\'Tis because you were a fool, understand that well.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Possibly; but what was his object?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \\'Twas pure quackery; in this way the spectator would sit\\nmotionless, waiting, waiting for Niobé to say something, and the piece\\nwould go running on.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! the rogue! how he deceived me! Well, Aeschylus, why are you\\nso restless? Why this impatience, eh?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \\'Tis because he sees himself beaten. Then when he had rambled\\non well, and got half-way through the piece, he would spout some dozen\\nbig, blustering, winged words, tall as mountains, terrible scarers, which\\nthe spectator admired without understanding what they meant.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! great gods!\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Silence!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. There was no comprehending one word.\\n\\nDIONYSUS (_to Aeschylus_). Don\\'t grind your teeth.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. There were Scamanders, abysses, griffins with eagles\\' beaks\\nchiselled upon brazen bucklers, all words with frowning crests and hard,\\nhard to understand.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. \\'Faith, I was kept awake almost an entire night, trying to\\nthink out his yellow bird, half cock and half horse.[474]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Why, fool, \\'tis a device that is painted on the prow of a\\nvessel.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Ah! I actually thought \\'twas Eryxis, the son of\\nPhiloxenus.[475]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. But what did you want with a cock in tragedy?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. But you, you foe of the gods, what have you done that is so\\ngood?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Oh! I have not made horses with cocks\\' heads like you, nor\\ngoats with deer\\'s horns, as you may see \\'em on Persian tapestries; but,\\nwhen I received tragedy from your hands, it was quite bloated with\\nenormous, ponderous words, and I began by lightening it of its heavy\\nbaggage and treated it with little verses, with subtle arguments, with\\nthe sap of white beet and decoctions of philosophical folly, the whole\\nbeing well filtered together;[476] then I fed it with monologues, mixing\\nin some Cephisophon;[477] but I did not chatter at random nor mix in any\\ningredients that first came to hand; from the outset I made my subject\\nclear, and told the origin of the piece.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Well, that was better than telling your own.[478]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Then, starting with the very first verse, each character\\nplayed his part; all spoke, both woman and slave and master, young girl\\nand old hag.[479]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. And was not such daring deserving of death?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. No, by Apollo! \\'twas to please the people.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! leave that alone, do; \\'tis not the best side of your case.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Furthermore, I taught the spectators the art of speech ...\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \\'Tis true indeed! Would that you had burst before you did it!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. ... the use of the straight lines and of the corners of\\nlanguage, the science of thinking, of reading, of understanding,\\nplotting, loving deceit, of suspecting evil, of thinking of\\neverything....\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Oh! true, true again!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I introduced our private life upon the stage, our common\\nhabits; and \\'twas bold of me, for everyone was at home with these and\\ncould be my critic; I did not burst out into big noisy words to prevent\\ntheir comprehension; nor did I terrify the audience by showing them\\nCycni[480] and Memnons[481] on chariots harnessed with steeds and\\njingling bells. Look at his disciples and look at mine. His are\\nPhormisius and Megaenetus of Magnesia[482], all a-bristle with long\\nbeards, spears and trumpets, and grinning with sardonic and ferocious\\nlaughter, while my disciples are Clitophon and the graceful\\nTheramenes.[483]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Theramenes? An able man and ready for anything; a man, who in\\nimminent dangers knew well how to get out of the scrape by saying he was\\nfrom Chios and not from Ceos.[484]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \\'Tis thus that I taught my audience how to judge, namely, by\\nintroducing the art of reasoning and considering into tragedy. Thanks to\\nme, they understand everything, discern all things, conduct their\\nhouseholds better and ask themselves, \"What is to be thought of this?\\nWhere is that? Who has taken the other thing?\"\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Yes, certainly, and now every Athenian who returns home, bawls\\nto his slaves, \"Where is the stew-pot? Who has eaten off the sprat\\'s\\nhead? Where is the clove of garlic that was left over from yesterday? Who\\nhas been nibbling at my olives?\" Whereas formerly they kept their seats\\nwith mouths agape like fools and idiots.\\n\\nCHORUS. You hear him, illustrious Achilles,[485] and what are you going\\nto reply? Only take care that your rage does not lead you astray, for he\\nhas handled you brutally. My noble friend, don\\'t get carried away; furl\\nall your sails, except the top-gallants, so that your ship may only\\nadvance slowly, until you feel yourself driven forward by a soft and\\nfavourable wind. Come then, you who were the first of the Greeks to\\nconstruct imposing monuments of words and to raise the old tragedy above\\nchildish trifling, open a free course to the torrent of your words.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. This contest rouses my gall; my heart is boiling over with\\nwrath. Am I bound to dispute with this fellow? But I will not let him\\nthink me unarmed and helpless. So, answer me! what is it in a poet one\\nadmires?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Wise counsels, which make the citizens better.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. And if you have failed in this duty, if out of honest and\\npure-minded men you have made rogues, what punishment do you think is\\nyour meet?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Death. I will reply for him.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Behold then what great and brave men I bequeathed to him! They\\ndid not shirk the public burdens; they were not idlers, rogues and\\ncheats, as they are to-day; their very breath was spears, pikes, helmets\\nwith white crests, breastplates and greaves; they were gallant souls\\nencased in seven folds of ox-leather.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I must beware! he will crush me beneath the sheer weight of\\nhis hail of armour.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And how did you teach them this bravery? Speak, Aeschylus, and\\ndon\\'t display so much haughty swagger.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. By composing a drama full of the spirit of Ares.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Which one?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. The Seven Chiefs before Thebes. Every man who had once seen it\\nlonged to be marching to battle.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And you did very wrongly; through you the Thebans have become\\nmore warlike; for this misdeed you deserve to be well beaten.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. You too might have trained yourself, but you were not willing.\\nThen, by producing \\'The Persae,\\' I have taught you to conquer all your\\nenemies; \\'twas my greatest work.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Aye, I shook with joy at the announcement of the death of\\nDarius; and the Chorus immediately clapped their hands and shouted,\\n\"Triumph!\"[486]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Those are the subjects that poets should use. Note how useful,\\neven from remotest times, the poets of noble thought have been! Orpheus\\ntaught us the mystic rites and the horrid nature of murder; Musaeus, the\\nhealing of ailments and the oracles; Hesiod, the tilling of the soil and\\nthe times for delving and harvest. And does not divine Homer owe his\\nimmortal glory to his noble teachings? Is it not he who taught the\\nwarlike virtues, the art of fighting and of carrying arms?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. At all events he has not taught it to Pantacles,[487] the most\\nawkward of all men; t\\'other day, when he was directing a procession,\\n\\'twas only after he had put on his helmet that he thought of fixing in\\nthe crest.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. But he has taught a crowd of brave warriors, such as\\nLamachus,[488] the hero of Athens. \\'Tis from Homer that I borrowed the\\nPatrocli and the lion-hearted Teucers,[489] whom I revived to the\\ncitizens, to incite them to show themselves worthy of these illustrious\\nexamples when the trumpets sounded. But I showed them neither\\nSthenoboea[490] nor shameless Phaedra; and I don\\'t remember ever having\\nplaced an amorous woman on the stage.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. No, no, you have never known Aphrodité.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. And I am proud of it. Whereas with you and those like you, she\\nappears everywhere and in every shape; so that even you yourself were\\nruined and undone by her.[491]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. That\\'s true; the crimes you imputed to the wives of others, you\\nsuffered from in turn.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. But, cursed man, what harm have my Sthenoboeas done to Athens?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. You are the cause of honest wives of honest citizens drinking\\nhemlock, so greatly have your Bellerophons made them blush.[492]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Why, did I invent the story of Phaedra?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. No, the story is true enough; but the poet should hide what is\\nvile and not produce nor represent it on the stage. The schoolmaster\\nteaches little children and the poet men of riper age. We must only\\ndisplay what is good.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. And when you talk to us of towering mountains--Lycabettus and\\nof the frowning Parnes[493]--is that teaching us what is good? Why not\\nuse human language?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Why, miserable man, the expression must always rise to the\\nheight of great maxims and of noble thoughts. Thus as the garment of the\\ndemi-gods is more magnificent, so also is their language more sublime. I\\nennobled the stage, while you have degraded it.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. And how so, pray?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Firstly you have dressed the kings in rags,[494] so that they\\nmight inspire pity.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Where\\'s the harm?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. You are the cause why no rich man will now equip the galleys,\\nthey dress themselves in tatters, groan and say they are poor.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Aye, by Demeter! and he wears a tunic of fine wool underneath;\\nand when he has deceived us with his lies, he may be seen turning up on\\nthe fish-market.[495]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Moreover, you have taught boasting and quibbling; the\\nwrestling schools are deserted and the young fellows have submitted their\\narses to outrage,[496] in order that they might learn to reel off idle\\nchatter, and the sailors have dared to bandy words with their\\nofficers.[497] In my day they only knew how to ask for their\\nship\\'s-biscuit and to shout \"Yo ho! heave ho!\"\\n\\nDIONYSUS. ... and to let wind under the nose of the rower below them, to\\nbefoul their mate with filth and to steal when they went ashore. Nowadays\\nthey argue instead of rowing and the ship can travel as slow as she\\nlikes.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Of what crimes is he not the author? Has he not shown us\\nprocurers, women who get delivered in the temples, have traffic with\\ntheir brothers,[498] and say that life is not life.[499] \\'Tis thanks to\\nhim that our city is full of scribes and buffoons, veritable apes, whose\\ngrimaces are incessantly deceiving the people; but there is no one left\\nwho knows how to carry a torch,[500] so little is it practised.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I\\' faith, that\\'s true! I almost died of laughter at the last\\nPanathenaea at seeing a slow, fat, pale-faced fellow, who ran well behind\\nall the rest, bent completely double and evidently in horrible pain. At\\nthe gate of the Ceramicus the spectators started beating his belly,\\nsides, flanks and thighs; these slaps knocked so much wind out of him\\nthat it extinguished his torch and he hurried away.\\n\\nCHORUS. \\'Tis a serious issue and an important debate; the fight is\\nproceeding hotly and its decision will be difficult; for, as violently as\\nthe one attacks, as cleverly and as subtly does the other reply. But\\ndon\\'t keep always to the same ground; you are not at the end of your\\nspecious artifices. Make use of every trick you have, no matter whether\\nit be old or new! Out with everything boldly, blunt though it be; risk\\nanything--that is smart and to the point. Perchance you fear that the\\naudience is too stupid to grasp your subtleties, but be reassured, for\\nthat is no longer the case. They are all well-trained folk; each has his\\nbook, from which he learns the art of quibbling; such wits as they are\\nhappily endowed with have been rendered still keener through study. So\\nhave no fear! Attack everything, for you face an enlightened audience.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Let\\'s take your prologues; \\'tis the beginnings of this able\\npoet\\'s tragedies that I wish to examine at the outset. He was obscure in\\nthe description of his subjects.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And which prologue are you going to examine?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. A lot of them. Give me first of all that of the\\n\\'Orestes.\\'[501]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. All keep silent, Aeschylus, recite.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \"Oh! Hermes of the nether world, whose watchful power executes\\nthe paternal bidding, be my deliverer, assist me, I pray thee. I come, I\\nreturn to this land.\"[502]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Is there a single word to condemn in that?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. More than a dozen.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. But there are but three verses in all.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. And there are twenty faults in each.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Aeschylus, I beg you to keep silent; otherwise, besides these\\nthree iambics, there will be many more attacked.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. What? Keep silent before this fellow?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. If you will take my advice.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. He begins with a fearful blunder. Do you see the stupid thing?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Faith! I don\\'t care if I don\\'t.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. A blunder? In what way?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Repeat the first verse.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \"Oh! Hermes of the nether world, whose watchful power executes\\nthe paternal bidding.\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Is not Orestes speaking in this fashion before his father\\'s\\ntomb?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Agreed.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Does he mean to say that Hermes had watched, only that\\nAgamemnon should perish at the hands of a woman and be the victim of a\\ncriminal intrigue?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \\'Tis not to the god of trickery, but to Hermes the benevolent,\\nthat he gives the name of god of the nether world, and this he proves by\\nadding that Hermes is accomplishing the mission given him by his father.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. The blunder is even worse than I had thought to make it out;\\nfor if he holds his office in the nether world from his father....\\n\\nDIONYSUS. It means his father has made him a grave-digger.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Dionysus, your wine is not redolent of perfume.[503]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Continue, Aeschylus, and you, Euripides, spy out the faults as\\nhe proceeds.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \"Be my deliverer, assist me, I pray thee. I come, I return to\\nthis land.\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Our clever Aeschylus says the very same thing twice over.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. How twice over?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Examine your expressions, for I am going to show you the\\nrepetition. \"I come, I return to this land.\" But I _come_ is the same\\nthing as I _return._\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Undoubtedly. \\'Tis as though I said to my neighbour, \"Lend me\\neither your kneading-trough or your trough to knead in.\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. No, you babbler, no, \\'tis not the same thing, and the verse is\\nexcellent.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Indeed! then prove it.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. To come is the act of a citizen who has suffered no\\nmisfortune; but the exile both comes and returns.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Excellent! by Apollo! What do you say to that, Euripides?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I say that Orestes did not return to his country, for he came\\nthere secretly, without the consent of those in power.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Very good indeed! by Hermes! only I have not a notion what it\\nis you mean.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Go on.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come, be quick, Aeschylus, continue; and you look out for the\\nfaults.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \"At the foot of this tomb I invoke my father and beseech him\\nto hearken to me and to hear.\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Again a repetition, to hearken and to hear are obviously the\\nsame thing.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Why, wretched man, he\\'s addressing the dead, whom to call\\nthrice even is not sufficient.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. And you, how do you form your prologues?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I am going to tell you, and if you find a repetition, an idle\\nword or inappropriate, let me be scouted!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come, speak; \\'tis my turn to listen. Let us hear the beauty of\\nyour prologues,\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Oedipus was a fortunate man at first ...\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Not at all; he was destined to misfortune before he even\\nexisted, since Apollo predicted he would kill his father before ever he\\nwas born. How can one say he was fortunate at first?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"... and he became the most unfortunate of mortals\\nafterwards.\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. No, he did not become so, for he never ceased being so. Look\\nat the facts! First of all, when scarcely born, he is exposed in the\\nmiddle of winter in an earthenware vessel, for fear he might become the\\nmurderer of his father, if brought up; then he came to Polybus with his\\nfeet swollen; furthermore, while young, he marries an old woman, who is\\nalso his mother, and finally he blinds himself.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. \\'Faith! I think he could not have done worse to have been a\\ncolleague of Erasinidas.[504]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You can chatter as you will, my prologues are very fine.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. I will take care not to carp at them verse by verse and word\\nfor word;[505] but, an it please the gods, a simple little bottle will\\nsuffice me for withering every one of your prologues.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You will wither my prologues with a little bottle?[506]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. With only one. You make verses of such a kind, that one can\\nadapt what one will to your iambics: a little bit of fluff, a little\\nbottle, a little bag. I am going to prove it.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You will prove it?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Yes.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come, recite.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Aegyptus, according to the most widely spread reports, having\\nlanded at Argos with his fifty daughters[507] ...\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. ... lost his little bottle.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What little bottle? May the plague seize you!\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Recite another prologue to him. We shall see.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Dionysus, who leads the choral dance on Parnassus with the\\nthyrsus in his hand and clothed in skins of fawns[508] ...\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. ... lost his little bottle.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. There again his little bottle upsets us.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. He won\\'t bother us much longer. I have a certain prologue to\\nwhich he cannot adapt his tag: \"There is no perfect happiness; this one\\nis of noble origin, but poor; another of humble birth[509] ...\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. ... lost his little bottle.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Euripides!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Clue up your sails, for this damned little bottle is going to\\nblow a gale.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Little I care, by Demeter! I am going to make it burst in his\\nhands.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Then out with it; recite another prologue, but beware, beware\\nof the little bottle.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Cadmus, the son of Agenor, while leaving the city of\\nSidon[510] ...\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. ... lost his little bottle.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! my poor friend; buy that bottle, do, for it is going to\\ntear all your prologues to ribbons.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What? Am I to buy it of him?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. If you take my advice.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. No, not I, for I have many prologues to which he cannot\\npossibly fit his catchword: \"Pelops, the son of Tantalus, having started\\nfor Pisa on his swift chariot[511] ...\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. ... lost his little bottle.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. D\\'ye see? Again he has popped in his little bottle. Come,\\nAeschylus, he is going to buy it of you at any price, and you can have a\\nsplendid one for an obolus.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. By Zeus, no, not yet! I have plenty of other prologues.\\n\"Oeneus in the fields one day[512] ...\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. ... lost his little bottle.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Let me first finish the opening verse: \"Oeneus in the fields\\none day, having made an abundant harvest and sacrificed the first-fruits\\nto the gods ...\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. ... lost his little bottle.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. During the sacrifice? And who was the thief?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Allow him to try with this one: \"Zeus, as even Truth has\\nsaid[513] ...\"\\n\\nDIONYSUS (_to Euripides_). You have lost again; he is going to say, \"lost\\nhis little bottle,\" for that bottle sticks to your prologues like a\\nringworm. But, in the name of the gods, turn now to his choruses.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I will prove that he knows nothing of lyric poetry, and that\\nhe repeats himself incessantly.\\n\\nCHORUS. What\\'s he going to say now? I am itching to know what criticisms\\nhe is going to make on the poet, whose sublime songs so far outclass\\nthose of his contemporaries. I cannot imagine with what he is going to\\nreproach the king of the Dionysia, and I tremble for the aggressor.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Oh! those wonderful songs! But watch carefully, for I am going\\nto condense them all into a single one.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And I am going to take pebbles to count the fragments.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Oh, Achilles, King of Phthiotis, hearken to the shout of the\\nconquering foe and haste to sustain the assault. We dwellers in the\\nmarshes do honour to Hermes, the author of our race. Haste to sustain the\\nassault.\"\\n\\nDIONYSUS. There, Aeschylus, you have already two assaults against you.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Oh, son of Atreus, the most illustrious of the Greeks, thou,\\nwho rulest so many nations, hearken to me. Haste to the assault.\"\\n\\nDIONYSUS. A third assault. Beware, Aeschylus.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Keep silent, for the inspired priestesses are opening the\\ntemple of Artemis. Haste to sustain the assault. I have the right to\\nproclaim that our warriors are leaving under propitious auspices. Haste\\nto sustain the assault.\"[514]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Great gods, what a number of assaults! my kidneys are quite\\nswollen with fatigue; I shall have to go to the bath after all these\\nassaults.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Not before you have heard this other song arranged for the\\nmusic of the cithara.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come then, continue; but, prithee, no more \"assaults.\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"What! the two powerful monarchs, who reign over the Grecian\\nyouth, phlattothrattophlattothrat, are sending the Sphinx, that terrible\\nharbinger of death, phlattothrattophlattothrat. With his avenging arm\\nbearing a spear, phlattothrattophlattothrat, the impetuous bird delivers\\nthose who lean to the side of Ajax, phlattothrattophlattothrat, to the\\ndogs who roam in the clouds, phlattothrattophlattothrat.\"[515]\\n\\nDIONYSUS (_to Aeschylus_). What is this \\'phlattothrat\\'? Does it come from\\nMarathon or have you picked it out of some labourer\\'s chanty?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. I took what was good and improved it still more, so that I\\nmight not be accused of gathering the same flowers as Phrynichus in the\\nmeadow of the Muse. But this man borrows from everybody, from the\\nsuggestions of prostitutes, from the sons of Melitus,[516] from the\\nCarian flute-music, from wailing women, from dancing-girls. I am going to\\nprove it, so let a lyre be brought. But what need of a lyre in his case?\\nWhere is the girl with the castanets? Come, thou Muse of Euripides; \\'tis\\nquite thy business to accompany songs of this sort.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. This Muse has surely done fellation in her day, like a Lesbian\\nwanton.[517]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \"Ye halcyons, who twitter over the ever-flowing billows of the\\nsea, the damp dew of the waves glistens on your wings; and you spiders,\\nwho we-we-we-we-we-weave the long woofs of your webs in the corners of\\nour houses with your nimble feet like the noisy shuttle, there where the\\ndolphin by bounding in the billows, under the influence of the flute,\\npredicts a favourable voyage; thou glorious ornaments of the vine, the\\nslender tendrils that support the grape. Child, throw thine arms about my\\nneck.\"[518] Do you note the harmonious rhythm?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Yes.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Do you note it?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Yes, undoubtedly.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. And does the author of such rubbish dare to criticize my\\nsongs? he, who imitates the twelve postures of Cyrené in his poetry?[519]\\nThere you have his lyric melodies, but I still want to give you a sample\\nof his monologues. \"Oh! dark shadows of the night! what horrible dream\\nare you sending me from the depths of your sombre abysses! Oh! dream,\\nthou bondsman of Pluto, thou inanimate soul, child of the dark night,\\nthou dread phantom in long black garments, how bloodthirsty, bloodthirsty\\nis thy glance! how sharp are thy claws! Handmaidens, kindle the lamp,\\ndraw up the dew of the rivers in your vases and make the water hot; I\\nwish to purify myself of this dream sent me by the gods. Oh! king of the\\nocean, that\\'s right, that\\'s right! Oh! my comrades, behold this wonder.\\nGlycé has robbed me of my cock and has fled. Oh, Nymphs of the mountains!\\noh! Mania! seize her! How unhappy I am! I was full busy with my work, I\\nwas sp-sp-sp-sp-spinning the flax that was on my spindle, I was rounding\\noff the clew that I was to go and sell in the market at dawn; and he flew\\noff, flew off, cleaving the air with his swift wings; he left to me\\nnothing but pain, pain! What tears, tears, poured, poured from my\\nunfortunate eyes! Oh! Cretans, children of Ida, take your bows; help me,\\nhaste hither, surround the house. And thou, divine huntress, beautiful\\nArtemis, come with thy hounds and search through the house. And thou\\nalso, daughter of Zeus, seize the torches in thy ready hands and go\\nbefore me to Glycé\\'s home, for I propose to go there and rummage\\neverywhere.\"[520]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. That\\'s enough of choruses.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Yes, faith, enough indeed! I wish now to see my verses weighed\\nin the scales; \\'tis the only way to end this poetic struggle.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Well then, come, I am going to sell the poet\\'s genius the same\\nway cheese is sold in the market.\\n\\nCHORUS. Truly clever men are possessed of an inventive mind. Here again\\nis a new idea that is marvellous and strange, and which another would not\\nhave thought of; as for myself I would not have believed anyone who had\\ntold me of it, I would have treated him as a driveller.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Come, hither to the scales.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS AND EURIPIDES. Here we are.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Let each one hold one of the scales, recite a verse, and not\\nlet go until I have cried, \"Cuckoo!\"\\n\\nAESCHYLUS AND EURIPIDES. We understand.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Well then, recite and keep your hands on the scales.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Would it had pleased the gods that the vessel Argo had never\\nunfurled the wings of her sails!\"[521]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \"Oh! river Sperchius! oh! meadows, where the oxen graze!\"[522]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Cuckoo! let go! Oh! the verse of Aeschylus sinks far the lower\\nof the two.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. And why?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Because, like the wool-merchants, who moisten their wares, he\\nhas thrown a river into his verse and has made it quite wet, whereas\\nyours was winged and flew away.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Come, another verse! You recite, Aeschylus, and you, weigh.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Hold the scales again.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS AND EURIPIDES. Ready.\\n\\nDIONYSUS (_to Euripides_). You begin.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Eloquence is Persuasion\\'s only sanctuary.\"[523]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \"Death is the only god whom gifts cannot bribe.\"[524]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Let go! let go! Here again our friend Aeschylus\\' verse drags\\ndown the scale; \\'tis because he has thrown in Death, the weightiest of\\nall ills.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. And I Persuasion; my verse is excellent.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Persuasion has both little weight and little sense. But hunt\\nagain for a big weighty verse and solid withal, that it may assure you\\nthe victory.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. But where am I to find one--where?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I\\'ll tell you one: \"Achilles has thrown two and four.\"[525]\\nCome, recite! \\'tis the last trial.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"With his arm he seized a mace, studded with iron.\"[526]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \"Chariot upon chariot and corpse upon corpse.\"[527]\\n\\nDIONYSUS (_to Euripides_) There you\\'re foiled again.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Why?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. There are two chariots and two corpses in the verse; why, \\'tis\\na weight a hundred Egyptians could not lift.[528]\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. \\'Tis no longer verse against verse that I wish to weigh, but\\nlet him clamber into the scale himself, he, his children, his wife,\\nCephisophon[529] and all his works; against all these I will place but\\ntwo of my verses on the other side.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I will _not_ be their umpire, for they are dear to me and I\\nwill not have a foe in either of them; meseems the one is mighty clever,\\nwhile the other simply delights me.\\n\\nPLUTO. Then you are foiled in the object of your voyage.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. And if I do decide?\\n\\nPLUTO. You shall take with you whichever of the twain you declare the\\nvictor; thus you will not have come in vain.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. That\\'s all right! Well then, listen; I have come down to find a\\npoet.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. And with what intent?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. So that the city, when once it has escaped the imminent dangers\\nof the war, may have tragedies produced. I have resolved to take back\\nwhichever of the two is prepared to give good advice to the citizens. So\\nfirst of all, what think you of Alcibiades?  For the city is in most\\ndifficult labour over this question.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. And what does it think about it?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What does it think? It regrets him, hates him, and yet wishes\\nto have him, all at the same time. But tell me your opinion, both of you.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I hate the citizen who is slow to serve his country, quick to\\ninvolve it in the greatest troubles, ever alert to his own interests, and\\na bungler where those of the State are at stake.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. That\\'s good, by Posidon! And you, what is your opinion?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. A lion\\'s whelp should not be reared within the city. No doubt\\nthat\\'s best; but if the lion has been reared, one must submit to his\\nways.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Zeus, the Deliverer! this puzzles me greatly. The one is\\nclever, the other clear and precise. Now each of you tell me your idea of\\nthe best way to save the State.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. If Cinesias were fitted to Cleocritus as a pair of wings, and\\nthe wind were to carry the two of them across the waves of the sea ...\\n\\nDIONYSUS. \\'Twould be funny. But what is he driving at?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. ... they could throw vinegar into the eyes of the foe in the\\nevent of a sea-fight. But I know something else I want to tell you.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Go on.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. When we put trust in what we mistrust and mistrust what we\\ntrust....\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What? I don\\'t understand. Tell us something less profound, but\\nclearer.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. If we were to mistrust the citizens, whom we trust, and to\\nemploy those whom we to-day neglect, we should be saved. Nothing succeeds\\nwith us; very well then, let\\'s do the opposite thing, and our deliverance\\nwill be assured.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Very well spoken. You are the most ingenious of men, a true\\nPalamedes![530] Is this fine idea your own or is it Cephisophon\\'s?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. My very own,--bar the vinegar, which is Cephisophon\\'s.\\n\\nDIONYSUS (_to Aeschylus_). And you, what have you to say?\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Tell me first who the commonwealth employs. Are they the just?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Oh! she holds _them_ in abhorrence.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. What, are then the wicked those she loves?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Not at all, but she employs them against her will.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. Then what deliverance can there be for a city that will\\nneither have cape nor cloak?[531]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Discover, I adjure you, discover a way to save her from\\nshipwreck.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. I will tell you the way on earth, but I won\\'t here.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. No, send her this blessing from here.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. They will be saved when they have learnt that the land of the\\nfoe is theirs and their own land belongs to the foe; that their vessels\\nare their true wealth, the only one upon which they can rely.[532]\\n\\nDIONYSUS. That\\'s true, but the dicasts devour everything.[533]\\n\\nPLUTO (_to Dionysus_). Now decide.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. \\'Tis for you to decide, but I choose him whom my heart prefers.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You called the gods to witness that you would bear me through;\\nremember your oath and choose your friends.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Yes, \"my tongue has sworn.\"[534] ... But I choose Aeschylus.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What have you done, you wretch?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. I? I have decided that Aeschylus is the victor. What then?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. And you dare to look me in the face after such a shameful\\ndeed?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. \"Why shameful, if the spectators do not think so?\"[535]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Cruel wretch, will you leave me pitilessly among the dead?\\n\\nDIONYSUS. \"Who knows if living be not dying,[536] if breathing be not\\nfeasting, if sleep be not a fleece?\"[537]\\n\\nPLUTO. Enter my halls. Come, Dionysus.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. What shall we do there?\\n\\nPLUTO. I want to entertain my guests before they leave.\\n\\nDIONYSUS. Well said, by Zeus; \\'tis the very thing to please me best.\\n\\nCHORUS. Blessed the man who has perfected wisdom! Everything is happiness\\nfor him. Behold Aeschylus; thanks to the talent, to the cleverness he has\\nshown, he returns to his country; and his fellow-citizens, his relations,\\nhis friends will all hail his return with joy. Let us beware of jabbering\\nwith Socrates and of disdaining the sublime notes of the tragic Muse. To\\npass an idle life reeling off grandiloquent speeches and foolish\\nquibbles, is the part of a madman.\\n\\nPLUTO. Farewell, Aeschylus! Go back to earth and may your noble precepts\\nboth save our city[538] and cure the mad; there are such, a many of them!\\nCarry this rope from me to Cleophon, this one to Myrmex and Nichomachus,\\nthe public receivers, and this other one to Archenomous.[539] Bid them\\ncome here at once and without delay; if not, by Apollo, I will brand them\\nwith the hot iron.[540] I will make one bundle of them and\\nAdimantus,[541] the son of Leucolophus,[542] and despatch the lot into\\nhell with all possible speed.\\n\\nAESCHYLUS. I will do your bidding, and do you make Sophocles occupy my\\nseat. Let him take and keep it for me, against I should ever return here.\\nIn fact I award him the second place among the tragic poets. As for this\\nimpostor, watch that he never usurps my throne, even should he be placed\\nthere in spite of himself.\\n\\nPLUTO (_to the Chorus of the Initiate_). Escort him with your sacred\\ntorches, singing to him as you go his own hymns and choruses.\\n\\nCHORUS. Ye deities of the nether world, grant a pleasant journey to the\\npoet who is leaving us to return to the light of day; grant likewise wise\\nand healthy thoughts to our city. Put an end to the fearful calamities\\nthat overwhelm us, to the awful clatter of arms. As for Cleophon and the\\nlikes of him, let them go, an it please them, and fight in their own\\nland.[543]\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFINIS OF \"THE FROGS\"', 'Temple of Demeter.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTHE THESMOPHORIAZUSAE\\n\\nor\\n\\nThe Women\\'s Festival\\n\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Great Zeus! will the swallow never appear to end the winter\\nof my discontent? Why the fellow has kept me on the run ever since early\\nthis morning; he wants to kill me, that\\'s certain. Before I lose my\\nspleen entirely, Euripides, can you at least tell me whither you are\\nleading me?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What need for you to hear what you are going to see?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. How is that? Repeat it. No need for me to hear....\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What you are going to see.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Nor consequently to see....\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What you have to hear.[544]\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. What is this wiseacre stuff you are telling me? I must\\nneither see nor hear.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Ah! but you have two things there that are essentially\\ndistinct.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Seeing and hearing.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Undoubtedly.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. In what way distinct?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. In this way. Formerly, when Ether separated the elements and\\nbore the animals that were moving in her bosom, she wished to endow them\\nwith sight, and so made the eye round like the sun\\'s disc and bored ears\\nin the form of a funnel.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. And because of this funnel I neither see nor hear. Ah! great\\ngods! I am delighted to know it. What a fine thing it is to talk with\\nwise men!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I will teach you many another thing of the sort.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. That\\'s well to know; but first of all I should like to find\\nout how to grow lame, so that I need not have to follow you all about.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Come, hear and give heed!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. I\\'m here and waiting.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Do you see that little door?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Yes, certainly.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Silence!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Silence about what? About the door?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Pay attention!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Pay attention and be silent about the door? Very well.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \\'Tis there that Agathon, the celebrated tragic poet,\\ndwells.[545]\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Who is this Agathon?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \\'Tis a certain Agathon....\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Swarthy, robust of build?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. No, another. You have never seen him?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. He has a big beard?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. No, no, evidently you have never seen him.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Never, so far as I know.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. And yet you have pedicated him. Well, it must have been\\nwithout knowing who he was. Ah! let us step aside; here is one of his\\nslaves bringing a brazier and some myrtle branches; no doubt he is going\\nto offer a sacrifice and pray for a happy poetical inspiration for\\nAgathon.\\n\\nSERVANT OF AGATHON. Silence! oh, people! keep your mouths sedately shut!\\nThe chorus of the Muses is moulding songs at my master\\'s hearth. Let the\\nwinds hold their breath in the silent Ether! Let the azure waves cease\\nmurmuring on the shore!...\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Brououou! brououou! (_Imitates the buzzing of a fly._)\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Keep quiet!  what are you saying there?\\n\\nSERVANT. ... Take your rest, ye winged races, and you, ye savage\\ninhabitants of the woods, cease from your erratic wandering ...\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Broum, broum, brououou.\\n\\nSERVANT. ... for Agathon, our master, the sweet-voiced poet, is going ...\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. ... to be pedicated?\\n\\nSERVANT. Whose voice is that?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \\'Tis the silent Ether.\\n\\nSERVANT. ... is going to construct the framework of a drama. He is\\nrounding fresh poetical forms, he is polishing them in the lathe and is\\nwelding them; he is hammering out sentences and metaphors; he is working\\nup his subject like soft wax. First he models it and then he casts it in\\nbronze ...\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. ... and sways his buttocks amorously.\\n\\nSERVANT. Who is the rustic who approaches this sacred enclosure?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Take care of yourself and of your sweet-voiced poet! I have\\na strong instrument here both well rounded and well polished, which will\\npierce your enclosure and penetrate your bottom.\\n\\nSERVANT. Old man, you must have been a very insolent fellow in your\\nyouth!\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_to the servant_). Let him be, friend, and, quick, go and call\\nAgathon to me.\\n\\nSERVANT. \\'Tis not worth the trouble, for he will soon be here himself. He\\nhas started to compose, and in winter[546] it is never possible to round\\noff strophes without coming to the sun to excite the imagination. (_He\\ndeparts._)\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. And what am I to do?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Wait till he comes.... Oh, Zeus! what hast thou in store for\\nme to-day?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. But, great gods, what is the matter then? What are you\\ngrumbling and groaning for? Tell me; you must not conceal anything from\\nyour father-in-law.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Some great misfortune is brewing against me.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. What is it?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. This day will decide whether it is all over with Euripides or\\nnot.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. But how? Neither the tribunals nor the Senate are sitting,\\nfor it is the third of the five days consecrated to Demeter.[547]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. That is precisely what makes me tremble; the women have\\nplotted my ruin, and to-day they are to gather in the Temple of Demeter\\nto execute their decision.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Why are they against you?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Because I mishandle them in my tragedies.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. By Posidon, you would seem to have thoroughly deserved your\\nfate. But how are you going to get out of the mess?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I am going to beg Agathon, the tragic poet, to go to the\\nThesmophoria.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. And what is he to do there?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. He would mingle with the women, and stand up for me, if\\nneedful.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Would he be openly present or secretly?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Secretly, dressed in woman\\'s clothes.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. That\\'s a clever notion, thoroughly worthy of you. The prize\\nfor trickery is ours.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Silence!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Here comes Agathon.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Where, where?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. That\\'s the man they are bringing out yonder on the\\nmachine.[548]\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. I am blind then! I see no man here, I only see Cyrené.[549]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Be still! He is getting ready to sing.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. What subtle trill, I wonder, is he going to warble to us?\\n\\nAGATHON. Damsels, with the sacred torch[550] in hand, unite your dance to\\nshouts of joy in honour of the nether goddesses; celebrate the freedom of\\nyour country.\\n\\nCHORUS. To what divinity is your homage addressed? I wish to mingle mine\\nwith it.\\n\\nAGATHON. Oh! Muse! glorify Phoebus with his golden bow, who erected the\\nwalls of the city of the Simois.[551]\\n\\nCHORUS. To thee, oh Phoebus, I dedicate my most beauteous songs; to thee,\\nthe sacred victor in the poetical contests.\\n\\nAGATHON. And praise Artemis too, the maiden huntress, who wanders on the\\nmountains and through the woods....\\n\\nCHORUS. I, in my turn, celebrate the everlasting happiness of the chaste\\nArtemis, the mighty daughter of Latona!\\n\\nAGATHON. ... and Latona and the tones of the Asiatic lyre, which wed so\\nwell with the dances of the Phrygian Graces.[552]\\n\\nCHORUS. I do honour to the divine Latona and to the lyre, the mother of\\nsongs of male and noble strains. The eyes of the goddess sparkle while\\nlistening to our enthusiastic chants. Honour to the powerful Phoebus!\\nHail! thou blessed son of Latona!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! ye venerable Genetyllides,[553] what tender and\\nvoluptuous songs! They surpass the most lascivious kisses in sweetness; I\\nfeel a thrill of delight pass up my rectum as I listen to them. Young\\nman, whoever you are, answer my questions, which I am borrowing from\\nAeschylus\\' \\'Lycurgeia.\\'[554] Whence comes this effeminate? What is his\\ncountry? his dress? What contradictions his life shows! A lyre and a\\nhair-net! A wrestling school oil flask and a girdle![555] What could be\\nmore contradictory? What relation has a mirror to a sword? And you\\nyourself, who are you? Do you pretend to be a man? Where is the sign of\\nyour manhood, your penis, pray? Where is the cloak, the footgear that\\nbelong to that sex? Are you a woman? Then where are your breasts? Answer\\nme. But you keep silent. Oh! just as you choose; your songs display your\\ncharacter quite sufficiently.\\n\\nAGATHON. Old man, old man, I hear the shafts of jealousy whistling by my\\nears, but they do not hit me. My dress is in harmony with my thoughts. A\\npoet must adopt the nature of his characters. Thus, if he is placing\\nwomen on the stage, he must contract all their habits in his own person.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Then you ride the high horse[556] when you are composing a\\nPhaedra.\\n\\nAGATHON. If the heroes are men, everything in him will be manly. What we\\ndon\\'t possess by nature, we must acquire by imitation.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. When you are staging Satyrs, call me; I will do my best to\\nhelp you from behind with standing tool.\\n\\nAGATHON. Besides, it is bad taste for a poet to be coarse and hairy. Look\\nat the famous Ibycus, at Anacreon of Teos, and at Alcaeus,[557] who\\nhandled music so well; they wore headbands and found pleasure in the\\nlascivious dances of Ionia. And have you not heard what a dandy\\nPhrynichus was[558] and how careful in his dress? For this reason his\\npieces were also beautiful, for the works of a poet are copied from\\nhimself.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Ah! so it is for this reason that Philocles, who is so\\nhideous, writes hideous pieces; Xenocles, who is malicious, malicious\\nones, and Theognis,[559] who is cold, such cold ones?\\n\\nAGATHON. Yes, necessarily and unavoidably; and \\'tis because I knew this\\nthat I have so well cared for my person.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. How, in the gods\\' name?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Come, leave off badgering him; I was just the same at his age,\\nwhen I began to write.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. At! then, by Zeus! I don\\'t envy you your fine manners.\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_to Agathon_). But listen to the cause that brings me here.\\n\\nAGATHON. Say on.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Agathon, wise is he who can compress many thoughts into few\\nwords.[560] Struck by a most cruel misfortune, I come to you as a\\nsuppliant.\\n\\nAGATHON. What are you asking?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. The women purpose killing me to-day during the Thesmophoria,\\nbecause I have dared to speak ill of them.\\n\\nAGATHON. And what can I do for you in the matter?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Everything. Mingle secretly with the women by making yourself\\npass as one of themselves; then do you plead my cause with your own lips,\\nand I am saved. You, and you alone, are capable of speaking of me\\nworthily.\\n\\nAGATHON. But why not go and defend yourself?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \\'Tis impossible. First of all, I am known; further, I have\\nwhite hair and a long beard; whereas you, you are good-looking, charming,\\nand are close-shaven; you are fair, delicate, and have a woman\\'s voice.\\n\\nAGATHON. Euripides!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Well?\\n\\nAGATHON. Have you not said in one of your pieces, \"You love to see the\\nlight, and don\\'t you believe your father loves it too?\"[561]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Yes.\\n\\nAGATHON. Then never you think I am going to expose myself in your stead;\\n\\'twould be madness. \\'Tis for you to submit to the fate that overtakes\\nyou; one must not try to trick misfortune, but resign oneself to it with\\ngood grace.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. This is why you, you wretch, offer your posterior with a\\ngood grace to lovers, not in words, but in actual fact.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. But what prevents your going there?\\n\\nAGATHON. I should run more risk than you would.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Why?\\n\\nAGATHON. Why? I should look as if I were wanting to trespass on secret\\nnightly pleasures of the women and to ravish their Aphrodité.[562]\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Of wanting to ravish indeed! you mean wanting to be\\nravished--in the rearward mode. Ah! great gods! a fine excuse truly!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Well then, do you agree?\\n\\nAGATHON. Don\\'t count upon it.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Oh! I am unfortunate indeed! I am undone!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Euripides, my friend, my son-in-law, never despair.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What can be done?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Send him to the devil and do with me as you like.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Very well then, since you devote yourself to my safety, take\\noff your cloak first.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. There, it lies on the ground. But what do you want to do\\nwith me?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. To shave off this beard of yours, and to remove your hair\\nbelow as well.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Do what you think fit; I yield myself entirely to you.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Agathon, you have always razors about you; lend me one.\\n\\nAGATHON. Take if yourself, there, out of that case.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Thanks. Sit down and puff out the right cheek.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! oh! oh!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What are you shouting for? I\\'ll cram a spit down your gullet,\\nif you\\'re not quiet.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! (_He springs up and starts running\\naway._)\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Where are you running to now?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. To the temple of the Eumenides.[563] No, by Demeter I won\\'t\\nlet myself be gashed like that.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. But you will get laughed at, with your face half-shaven like\\nthat.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Little care I.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. In the gods\\' names, don\\'t leave me in the lurch. Come here.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! by the gods! (_Resumes his seat._)\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Keep still and hold up your head. Why do you want to fidget\\nabout like this?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Mu, mu.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Well! why, mu, mu? There! \\'tis done and well done too!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS Ah! great god! It makes me feel quite light.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Don\\'t worry yourself; you look charming. Do you want to see\\nyourself?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Aye, that I do; hand the mirror here.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Do you see yourself?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. But this is not I, it is Clisthenes![564]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Stand up; I am now going to remove your hair. Bend down.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Alas! alas! they are going to grill me like a pig.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Come now, a torch or a lamp! Bend down and take care of the\\ntender end of your tail!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Aye, aye! but I\\'m afire! oh! oh! Water, water, neighbour, or\\nmy rump will be alight!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Keep up your courage!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Keep my courage, when I\\'m being burnt up?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Come, cease your whining, the worst is over.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! it\\'s quite black, all burnt below there all about the\\nhole!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Don\\'t worry! that will be washed off with a sponge.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Woe to him who dares to wash my rump!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Agathon, you refuse to devote yourself to helping me; but at\\nany rate lend me a tunic and a belt. You cannot say you have not got\\nthem.\\n\\nAGATHON. Take them and use them as you like; I consent.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. What must be taken?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What must be taken? First put on this long saffron-coloured\\nrobe.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. By Aphrodité! what a sweet odour! how it smells of a man\\'s\\ngenitals![565] Hand it me quickly. And the belt?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Here it is.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Now some rings for my legs.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You still want a hair-net and a head-dress.\\n\\nAGATHON. Here is my night-cap.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Ah! that\\'s capital.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Does it suit me?\\n\\nAGATHON. It could not be better.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. And a short mantle?\\n\\nAGATHON. There\\'s one on the couch; take it.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. He wants slippers.\\n\\nAGATHON. Here are mine.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Will they fit me? You like a loose fit.[566]\\n\\nAGATHON. Try them on. Now that you have all you need, let me be taken\\ninside.[567]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You look for all the world like a woman. But when you talk,\\ntake good care to give your voice a woman\\'s tone.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. I\\'ll try my best.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Come, get yourself to the temple.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. No, by Apollo, not unless you swear to me ...\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. ... that, if anything untoward happen to me, you will leave\\nnothing undone to save me.\\n\\nEURIPIDES Very well! I swear it by the Ether, the dwelling-place of the\\nking of the gods.[568]\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Why not rather swear it by the disciples of\\nHippocrates?[569]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Come, I swear it by all the gods, both great and small.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Remember, \\'tis the heart, and not the tongue, that has\\nsworn;[570] for the oaths of the tongue concern me but little.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Hurry yourself! The signal for the meeting has just been\\ndisplayed on the Temple of Demeter. Farewell. [_Exit._\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Here, Thratta, follow me.[571] Look, Thratta, at the cloud\\nof smoke that arises from all these lighted torches. Ah! beautiful\\nThesmophorae![572] grant me your favours, protect me, both within the\\ntemple and on my way back! Come, Thratta, put down the basket and take\\nout the cake, which I wish to offer to the two goddesses. Mighty\\ndivinity, oh, Demeter, and thou, Persephoné, grant that I may be able to\\noffer you many sacrifices; above all things, grant that I may not be\\nrecognized. Would that my young daughter might marry a man as rich as he\\nis foolish and silly, so that she may have nothing to do but amuse\\nherself. But where can a place be found for hearing well? Be off,\\nThratta, be off; slaves have no right to be present at this\\ngathering.[573]\\n\\nHERALD. Silence! Silence!

Address these\\nprayers to heaven and demand happiness for yourselves. Io Paean! Io\\nPaean! Let us rejoice!\\n\\nCHORUS. May the gods deign to accept our vows and our prayers! Oh!\\nalmighty Zeus, and thou, god with the golden lyre,[577] who reignest on\\nsacred Delos, and thou, oh, invincible virgin, Pallas, with the eyes of\\nazure and the spear of gold, who protectest our illustrious city, and\\nthou, the daughter of the beautiful Latona, the queen of the\\nforests,[578] who art adored under many names, hasten hither at my call.\\nCome, thou mighty Posidon, king of the Ocean, leave thy stormy whirlpools\\nof Nereus; come goddesses of the seas, come, ye nymphs, who wander on the\\nmountains. Let us unite our voices to the sounds of the golden lyre, and\\nmay wisdom preside at the gathering of the noble matrons of Athens.\\n\\nHERALD. Address your prayers to the gods and goddesses of Olympus, of\\nDelphi, Delos and all other places; if there be a man who is plotting\\nagainst the womenfolk or who, to injure them, is proposing peace to\\nEuripides and the Medes, or who aspires to usurping the tyranny, plots\\nthe return of a tyrant, or unmasks a supposititious child; or if there be\\na slave who, a confidential party to a wife\\'s intrigues, reveals them\\nsecretly to her husband, or who, entrusted with a message, does not\\ndeliver the same faithfully; if there be a lover who fulfils naught of\\nwhat he has promised a woman, whom he has abused on the strength of his\\nlies, if there be an old woman who seduces the lover of a maiden by dint\\nof her presents and treacherously receives him in her house; if there be\\na host or hostess who sells false measure, pray the gods that they will\\noverwhelm them with their wrath, both them and their families, and that\\nthey may reserve all their favours for you.\\n\\nCHORUS. Let us ask the fulfilment of these wishes both for the city and\\nfor the people, and may the wisest of us cause her opinion to be\\naccepted. But woe to those women who break their oaths, who speculate on\\nthe public misfortune, who seek to alter the laws and the decrees, who\\nreveal our secrets to the foe and admit the Medes into our territory so\\nthat they may devastate it! I declare them both impious and criminal. Oh!\\nalmighty Zeus! see to it that the gods protect us, albeit we are but\\nwomen!\\n\\nHERALD. Hearken, all of you! this is the decree passed by the Senate of\\nthe Women under the presidency of Timoclea and at the suggestion of\\nSostrata; it is signed by Lysilla, the secretary: \"There will be a\\ngathering of the people on the morning of the third day of the\\nThesmophoria, which is a day of rest for us; the principal business there\\nshall be the punishment that it is meet to inflict upon Euripides for the\\ninsults with which he has loaded us.\" Now who asks to speak?\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. I do.\\n\\nHERALD. First put on this garland, and then speak. Silence! let all be\\nquiet! Pay attention! for here she is spitting as orators generally do\\nbefore they begin; no doubt she has much to say.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. If I have asked to speak, may the goddesses bear me witness,\\nit was not for sake of ostentation. But I have long been pained to see us\\nwomen insulted by this Euripides, this son of the green-stuff woman,[579]\\nwho loads us with every kind of indignity. Has he not hit us enough,\\ncalumniated us sufficiently, wherever there are spectators, tragedians,\\nand a chorus? Does he not style us gay, lecherous, drunken, traitorous,\\nboastful? Does he not repeat that we are all vice, that we are the curse\\nof our husbands? So that, directly they come back from the theatre, they\\nlook at us doubtfully and go searching every nook, fearing there may be\\nsome hidden lover. We can do nothing as we used to, so many are the false\\nideas which he has instilled into our husbands. Is a woman weaving a\\ngarland for herself? \\'Tis because she is in love.[580] Does she let some\\nvase drop while going or returning to the house? her husband asks her in\\nwhose honour she has broken it, \"It can only be for that Corinthian\\nstranger.\"[581] Is a maiden unwell? Straightway her brother says, \"That\\nis a colour that does not please me.\"[582] And if a childless woman\\nwishes to substitute one, the deceit can no longer be a secret, for the\\nneighbours will insist on being present at her delivery. Formerly the old\\nmen married young girls, but they have been so calumniated that none\\nthink of them now, thanks to the verse: \"A woman is the tyrant of the old\\nman who marries her.\"[583] Again, it is because of Euripides that we are\\nincessantly watched, that we are shut up behind bolts and bars, and that\\ndogs are kept to frighten off the gallants. Let that pass; but formerly\\nit was we who had the care of the food, who fetched the flour from the\\nstoreroom, the oil and the wine; we can do it no more. Our husbands now\\ncarry little Spartan keys on their persons, made with three notches and\\nfull of malice and spite.[584] Formerly it sufficed to purchase a ring\\nmarked with the same sign for three obols, to open the most securely\\nsealed-up door;[585] but now this pestilent Euripides has taught men to\\nhang seals of worm-eaten wood about their necks.[586] My opinion,\\ntherefore, is that we should rid ourselves of our enemy by poison or by\\nany other means, provided he dies. That is what I announce publicly; as\\nto certain points, which I wish to keep secret, I propose to record them\\non the secretary\\'s minutes.\\n\\nCHORUS. Never have I listened to a cleverer or more eloquent woman.\\nEverything she says is true; she has examined the matter from all sides\\nand has weighed up every detail. Her arguments are close, varied, and\\nhappily chosen. I believe that Xenocles himself, the son of Carcinus,\\nwould seem to talk mere nonsense, if placed beside her.\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. I have only a very few words to add, for the last speaker\\nhas covered the various points of the indictment; allow me only to tell\\nyou what happened to me. My husband died at Cyprus, leaving me five\\nchildren, whom I had great trouble to bring up by weaving chaplets on the\\nmyrtle market. Anyhow, I lived as well as I could until this wretch had\\npersuaded the spectators by his tragedies that there were no gods; since\\nthen I have not sold as many chaplets by half. I charge you therefore and\\nexhort you all to punish him, for does he not deserve it in a thousand\\nrespects, he who loads you with troubles, who is as coarse toward you as\\nthe green-stuff upon which his mother reared him? But I must back to the\\nmarket to weave my chaplets; I have twenty to deliver yet.\\n\\nCHORUS. This is even more animated and more trenchant than the first\\nspeech; all she has just said is full of good sense and to the point; it\\nis clever, clear and well calculated to convince. Yes! we must have\\nstriking vengeance on the insults of Euripides.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh, women! I am not astonished at these outbursts of fiery\\nrage; how could your bile not get inflamed against Euripides, who has\\nspoken so ill of you? As for myself, I hate the man, I swear it by my\\nchildren; \\'twould be madness not to hate him! Yet, let us reflect a\\nlittle; we are alone and our words will not be repeated outside. Why be\\nso bent on his ruin? Because he has known and shown up two or three of\\nour faults, when we have a thousand? As for myself, not to speak of other\\nwomen, I have more than one great sin upon my conscience, but this is the\\nblackest of them. I had been married three days and my husband was asleep\\nby my side; I had a lover, who had seduced me when I was seven years old;\\nimpelled by his passion, he came scratching at the door; I understood at\\nonce he was there and was going down noiselessly. \"Where are you going?\"\\nasked my husband. \"I am suffering terribly with colic,\" I told him, \"and\\nam going to the closet.\" \"Go,\" he replied, and started pounding together\\njuniper berries, aniseed, and sage.[587] As for myself, I moistened the\\ndoor-hinge[588] and went to find my lover, who embraced me,\\nhalf-reclining upon Apollo\\'s altar[589] and holding on to the sacred\\nlaurel with one hand. Well now! Consider! that is a thing of which\\nEuripides has never spoken. And when we bestow our favours on slaves and\\nmuleteers for want of better, does he mention this? And when we eat\\ngarlic early in the morning after a night of wantonness, so that our\\nhusband, who has been keeping guard upon the city wall, may be reassured\\nby the smell and suspect nothing,[590] has Euripides ever breathed a word\\nof this? Tell me. Neither has he spoken of the woman who spreads open a\\nlarge cloak before her husband\\'s eyes to make him admire it in full\\ndaylight to conceal her lover by so doing and afford him the means of\\nmaking his escape. I know another, who for ten whole days pretended to be\\nsuffering the pains of labour until she had secured a child; the husband\\nhurried in all directions to buy drugs to hasten her deliverance, and\\nmeanwhile an old woman brought the infant in a stew-pot; to prevent its\\ncrying she had stopped up its mouth with honey. With a sign she told the\\nwife that she was bringing a child for her, who at once began exclaiming,\\n\"Go away, friend, go away, I think I am going to be delivered; I can feel\\nhim kicking his heels in the belly ... of the stew-pot.\"[591] The husband\\ngoes off full of joy, and the old wretch quickly picks the honey out of\\nthe child\\'s mouth, which sets a-crying; then she seizes the babe, runs to\\nthe father and tells him with a smile on her face, \"\\'Tis a lion, a lion,\\nthat is born to you; \\'tis your very image. Everything about it is like\\nyou, even to its little tool, which is all twisty like a fir-cone.\" Are\\nthese not our everyday tricks? Why certainly, by Artemis, and we are\\nangry with Euripides, who assuredly treats us no worse than we deserve!\\n\\nCHORUS. Great gods! where has she unearthed all that? What country gave\\nbirth to such an audacious woman? Oh! you wretch! I should not have\\nthought ever a one of us could have spoken in public with such impudence.\\n\\'Tis clear, however, that we must expect everything and, as the old\\nproverb says, must look beneath every stone, lest it conceal some\\norator[592] ready to sting us. There is but one thing in the world worse\\nthan a shameless woman, and that\\'s another woman.\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. By Aglaurus![593] you have lost your wits, friends! You must\\nbe bewitched to suffer this plague to belch forth insults against us all.\\nIs there no one has any spirit at all? If not, we and our maid-servants\\nwill punish her. Run and fetch coals and let\\'s depilate her cunt in\\nproper style, to teach her not to speak ill of her sex.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! no! have mercy, friends. Have we not the right to speak\\nfrankly at this gathering? And because I have uttered what I thought\\nright in favour of Euripides, do you want to depilate me for my trouble?\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. What! we ought not to punish you, who alone have dared to\\ndefend the man who has done us so much harm, whom it pleases to put all\\nthe vile women that ever were upon the stage, who only shows us\\nMelanippés Phaedras? But of Penelopé he has never said a word, because\\nshe was reputed chaste and good.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. I know the reason. \\'Tis because not a single Penelopé exists\\namong the women of to-day, but all without exception are Phaedras.\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. Women, you hear how this creature still dares to speak of us\\nall.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. And, \\'faith, I have not said all that I know. Do you want\\nany more?\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. You cannot tell us any more; you have emptied your bag.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Why, I have not told the thousandth part of what we women\\ndo. Have I said how we use the hollow handles of our brooms to draw up\\nwine unbeknown to our husbands.\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. The cursed jade!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. And how we give meats to our lovers at the feast of the\\nApaturia and then accuse the cat....\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. She\\'s mad!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. ... Have I mentioned the woman who killed her husband with a\\nhatchet? Of another, who caused hers to lose his reason with her potions?\\nAnd of the Acharnian woman ...\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. Die, you bitch!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. ... who buried her father beneath the bath?[594]\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. And yet we listen to such things?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Have I told how you attributed to yourself the male child\\nyour slave had just borne and gave her your little daughter?\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. This insult calls for vengeance. Look out for your hair!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. By Zeus! don\\'t touch me.\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. There!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. There! tit for tat! (_They exchange blows._)\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. Hold my cloak, Philista!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Come on then, and by Demeter ...\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. Well! what?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. ... I\\'ll make you disgorge the sesame-cake you have\\neaten.[595]\\n\\nCHORUS. Cease wrangling! I see a woman[596] running here in hot haste.\\nKeep silent, so that we may hear the better what she has to say.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Friends, whom I copy in all things, my hairless chin\\nsufficiently evidences how dear you are to me; I am women-mad and make\\nmyself their champion wherever I am. Just now on the market-place I heard\\nmention of a thing that is of the greatest importance to you; I come to\\ntell it you, to let you know it, so that you may watch carefully and be\\non your guard against the danger which threatens you.\\n\\nCHORUS. What is it, my child? I can well call you child, for you have so\\nsmooth a skin.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. \\'Tis said that Euripides has sent an old man here to-day, one\\nof his relations ...\\n\\nCHORUS. With what object? What is his purpose?\\n\\nCLISTHENES. ... so that he may hear your speeches and inform him of your\\ndeliberations and intentions.\\n\\nCHORUS. But how would a man fail to be recognized amongst women?\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Euripides singed and depilated him and disguised him as a\\nwoman.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. This is pure invention! What man is fool enough to let\\nhimself be depilated? As for myself, I don\\'t believe a word of it.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Are you mad? I should not have come here to tell you, if I\\ndid not know it on indisputable authority.\\n\\nCHORUS. Great gods! what is it you tell us! Come, women, let us not lose\\na moment; let us search and rummage everywhere! Where can this man have\\nhidden himself escape our notice? Help us to look, Clisthenes; we shall\\nthus owe you double thanks, dear friend.\\n\\nCLISTHENES (_to a fourth woman_). Well then! let us see. To begin with\\nyou; who are you?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS (_aside_). Wherever am I to stow myself?\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Each and every one must pass the scrutiny.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS (_aside_). Oh! great gods!\\n\\nFOURTH WOMAN. You ask me who I am? I am the wife of Cleonymus.[597]\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Do you know this woman?\\n\\nCHORUS. Yes, yes, pass on to the rest.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. And she who carries the child?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS (_aside_). I\\'m a dead man. (_He runs off._)\\n\\nCLISTHENES (_to Mnesilochus_). Hi! you there! where are you off to? Stop\\nthere. What are you running away for?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. I want to relieve myself.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. The shameless thing! Come, hurry yourself; I will wait here\\nfor you.\\n\\nCHORUS. Wait for her and examine her closely; \\'tis the only one we do\\nnot know.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. You are a long time about your business.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Aye, my god, yes; \\'tis because I am unwell, for I ate cress\\nyesterday.[598]\\n\\nCLISTHENES. What are you chattering about cress? Come here and be quick.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! don\\'t pull a poor sick woman about like that.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Tell me, who is your husband?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. My husband? Do you know a certain individual at\\nCothocidae[599]...?\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Whom do you mean? Give his name.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \\'Tis an individual to whom the son of a certain individual\\none day....\\n\\nCLISTHENES. You are drivelling! Let\\'s see, have you ever been here\\nbefore?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Why certainly, every year.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Who is your tent companion?[600]\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \\'Tis a certain.... Oh! my god!\\n\\nCLISTHENES. You don\\'t answer.\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. Withdraw, all of you; I am going to examine her thoroughly\\nabout last year\\'s mysteries. But move away, Clisthenes, for no man may\\nhear what is going to be said. Now answer my questions! What was done\\nfirst?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Let\\'s see then. What was done first? Oh! we drank.\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. And then?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. We drank to our healths.\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. You will have heard that from someone. And then?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Xenylla relieved herself in a cup, for there was no other\\nvessel.\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. You trifle. Here, Clisthenes, here! This is the man of whom\\nyou spoke.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. What is to be done then?\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. Take off his clothes, I can get nothing out of him.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. What! are you going to strip a mother of nine children\\nnaked?\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Come, undo your girdle, you shameless thing.\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. Ah! what a sturdy frame! but she has no breasts like we\\nhave.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. That\\'s because I\\'m barren. I never had any children.\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. Oh! indeed! just now you were the mother of nine.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Stand up straight. Hullo! what do I see there?  Why, a penis\\nsticking out behind.\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. There\\'s no mistaking it; you can see it projecting, and a\\nfine red it is.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Where has it gone to now?\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. To the front.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. No.\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. Ah! \\'tis behind now.\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Why, friend, \\'tis for all the world like the Isthmus; you\\nkeep pulling your tool backwards and forwards just as the Corinthians do\\ntheir ships.[601]\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. Ah! the wretch! this is why he insulted us and defended\\nEuripides.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Aye, wretch indeed, what troubles have I not got into now!\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. What shall we do?\\n\\nCLISTHENES. Watch him closely, so that he does not escape. As for me, I\\ngo to report the matter to the magistrates, the Prytanes.\\n\\nCHORUS. Let us kindle our lamps; let us go firmly to work and with\\ncourage, let us take off our cloaks and search whether some other man has\\nnot come here too; let us pass round the whole Pnyx,[602] examine the\\ntents and the passages.[603] Come, be quick, let us start off on a light\\ntoe[604] and rummage all round in silence. Let us hasten, let us finish\\nour round as soon as possible. Look quickly for the traces that might\\nshow you a man hidden here, let your glance fall on every side; look well\\nto the right and to the left. If we seize some impious fellow, woe to\\nhim! He will know how we punish the outrage, the crime, the sacrilege.\\nThe criminal will then acknowledge at last that gods exist; his fate will\\nteach all men that the deities must be revered, that justice must be\\nobserved and that they must submit to the sacred laws. If not, then woe\\nto them! Heaven itself will punish sacrilege; being aflame with fury and\\nmad with frenzy, all their deeds will prove to mortals, both men and\\nwomen, that the deity punishes injustice and impiety, and that she is not\\nslow to strike. But I think I have now searched everywhere and that no\\nother man is hidden among us.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Where is he flying to? Stop him! stop him! Ah! miserable\\nwoman that I am, he has torn my child from my breast and has disappeared\\nwith it.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Scream as loud as you will, but he shall never suck your\\nbosom more. If you do not let me go this very instant, I am going to cut\\nopen the veins of his thighs with this cutlass and his blood shall flow\\nover the altar.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Oh! great gods! oh! friends, help me! terrify him with your\\nshrieks, triumph over this monster, permit him not to rob me of my only\\nchild.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! oh! venerable Parcae, what fresh attack is this? \\'Tis the\\ncrowning act of audacity and shamelessness! What has he done now,\\nfriends, what has he done?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Ah! this insolence passes all bounds, but I shall know how\\nto curb it.\\n\\nCHORUS. What a shameful deed! the measure of his iniquities is full!\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Aye, \\'tis shameful that he should have robbed me of my\\nchild.\\n\\nCHORUS. \\'Tis past belief to be so criminal and so impudent!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Ah! you\\'re not near the end of it yet.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Little I care whence you come; you shall not return to boast\\nof having acted so odiously with impunity, for you shall be punished.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. You won\\'t do it, by the gods!\\n\\nCHORUS. And what immortal would protect you for your crime?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \\'Tis in vain you talk! I shall not let go the child.\\n\\nCHORUS. By the goddesses, you will not laugh presently over your crime\\nand your impious speech. For with impiety, as \\'tis meet, shall we reply\\nto your impiety. Soon fortune will turn round and overwhelm you. Come!\\nbring wood along. Let us burn the wretch, let us roast him as quickly as\\npossible.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Bring faggots, Mania! (_To Mnesilochus._) You will be mere\\ncharcoal soon.\\n\\nCHORUS. Grill away, roast me, but you, my child, take off this Cretan\\nrobe and blame no one but your mother for your death. But what does this\\nmean? The little girl is nothing but a skin filled with wine and shod\\nwith Persian slippers.[605] Oh! you wanton, you tippling woman, who think\\nof nothing but wine; you are a fortune to the drinking-shops and are our\\nruin; for the sake of drink, you neglect both your household and your\\nshuttle!\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Faggots, Mania, plenty of them.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Bring as many as you like. But answer me; are you the mother\\nof this brat?\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. I carried it ten months.[606]\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. You carried it?\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. I swear it by Artemis.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. How much does it hold? Three cotylae?[607] Tell me.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Oh! what have you done? You have stripped the poor child\\nquite naked, and it is so small, so small.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. So small?\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Yes, quite small, to be sure.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. How old is it? Has it seen the feast of cups thrice or four\\ntimes?\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. It was born about the time of the last Dionysia.[608] But\\ngive it back to me.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. No, may Apollo bear me witness.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Well, then we are going to burn him.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Burn me, but then I shall rip this open instantly.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. No, no, I adjure you, don\\'t; do anything you like to me\\nrather than that.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. What a tender mother you are; but nevertheless I shall rip\\nit open. (_Tears open the wine-skin_.)\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Oh, my beloved daughter! Mania, hand me the sacred cup, that\\nI may at least catch the blood of my child.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Hold it below; \\'tis the sole favour I grant you.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Out upon you, you pitiless monster!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. This robe belongs to the priestess.[609]\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. What belongs to the priestess?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Here, take it. (_Throws her the Cretan robe._)\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Ah! unfortunate Mica! who has robbed you of your daughter,\\nyour beloved child?\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. That wretch. But as you are here, watch him well, while I go\\nwith Clisthenes to the Prytanes and denounce him for his crimes.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Ah! how can I secure safety? what device can I hit on? what\\ncan I think of? He whose fault it is, he who hurried me into this\\ntrouble, will not come to my rescue. Let me see, whom could I best send\\nto him? Ha! I know a means taken from Palamedes; like him, I will write\\nmy misfortune on some oars, which I will cast into the sea. But there are\\nno oars here. Where might I find some?[610] Where indeed? Bah! what if I\\ntook these statues[611] instead of oars, wrote upon them and then threw\\nthem towards this side and that. \\'Tis the best thing to do. Besides, like\\noars they are of wood. Oh! my hands, keep up your courage, for my safety\\nis at stake. Come, my beautiful tablets, receive the traces of my stylus\\nand be the messengers of my sorry fate. Oh! oh! this B looks miserable\\nenough! Where is it running to then? Come, off with you in all\\ndirections, to the right and to the left; and hurry yourselves, for\\nthere\\'s much need indeed!\\n\\nCHORUS. Let us address ourselves to the spectators to sing our praises,\\ndespite the fact that each one says much ill of women. If the men are to\\nbe believed, we are a plague to them; through us come all their troubles,\\nquarrels, disputes, sedition, griefs and wars. But if we are truly such a\\npest, why marry us? Why forbid us to go out or show ourselves at the\\nwindow? You want to keep this pest, and take a thousand cares to do it.\\nIf your wife goes out and you meet her away from the house, you fly into\\na fury. Ought you not rather to rejoice and give thanks to the gods? for\\nif the pest has disappeared, you will no longer find it at home. If we\\nfall asleep at friends\\' houses from the fatigue of playing and sporting,\\neach of you comes prowling round the bed to contemplate the features of\\nthis pest. If we seat ourselves at the window, each one wants to see the\\npest, and if we withdraw through modesty, each wants all the more to see\\nthe pest perch herself there again. It is thus clear that we are better\\nthan you, and the proof of this is easy. Let us find out which is worse\\nof the two sexes. We say, \"\\'Tis you,\" while you aver, \\'tis we. Come, let\\nus compare them in detail, each individual man with a woman. Charminus is\\nnot equal to Nausimaché,[612] that\\'s certain. Cleophon[613] is in every\\nrespect inferior to Salabaccho.[614] \\'Tis long now since any of you has\\ndared to contest the prize with Aristomaché, the heroine of Marathon, or\\nwith Stratonicé.[615]\\n\\nAmong the last year\\'s Senators, who have just yielded their office to\\nother citizens, is there one who equals Eubulé?[616] Therefore we\\nmaintain that men are greatly our inferiors. You see no woman who has\\nrobbed the State of fifty talents rushing about the city in a magnificent\\nchariot; our greatest peculations are a measure of corn, which we steal\\nfrom our husbands, and even then we return it them the very same day. But\\nwe could name many amongst you who do quite as much, and who are, even\\nmore than ourselves, gluttons, parasites, cheats and kidnappers of\\nslaves. We know how to keep our property better than you. We still have\\nour cylinders, our beams,[617] our baskets and our sunshades; whereas\\nmany among you have lost the wood of your spears as well as the iron, and\\nmany others have cast away their bucklers on the battlefield.\\n\\nThere are many reproaches we have the right to bring against men. The\\nmost serious is this, that the woman, who has given birth to a useful\\ncitizen, whether taxiarch or strategus[618] should receive some\\ndistinction; a place of honour should be reserved for her at the Sthenia,\\nthe Scirophoria,[619] and the other festivals that we keep. On the other\\nhand, she of whom a coward was born or a worthless man, a bad\\ntrierarch[620] or an unskilful pilot, should sit with shaven head, behind\\nher sister who had borne a brave man. Oh! citizens! is it just, that the\\nmother of Hyperbolus should sit dressed in white and with loosened\\ntresses beside that of Lamachus[621] and lend out money on usury? He, who\\nmay have done a deal of this nature with her, so far from paying her\\ninterest, should not even repay the capital, saying, \"What, pay you\\ninterest? after you have given us this delightful son?\"\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. I have contracted quite a squint by looking round for him,\\nand yet Euripides does not come. Who is keeping him? No doubt he is\\nashamed of his cold Palamedes.[622] What will attract him? Let us see! By\\nwhich of his pieces does he set most store? Ah! I\\'ll imitate his\\nHelen,[623] his lastborn. I just happen to have a complete woman\\'s\\noutfit.\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. What are you ruminating over now again? Why are you\\nrolling up your eyes? You\\'ll have no reason to be proud of your Helen, if\\nyou don\\'t keep quiet until one of the Prytanes arrives.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS (_as Helen_). \"These shores are those of the Nile with the\\nbeautiful nymphs, these waters take the place of heaven\\'s rain and\\nfertilize the white earth, that produces the black syrmea.\"[624]\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. By bright Hecaté, you\\'re a cunning varlet.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"Glorious Sparta is my country and Tyndareus is my\\nfather.\"[625]\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. He your father, you rascal! Why, \\'tis Phrynondas.[626]\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"I was given the name of Helen.\"\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. What! you are again becoming a woman, before we have\\npunished you for having pretended it a first time!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"A thousand warriors have died on my account on the banks of\\nthe Scamander.\"\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Why have you not done the same?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"And here I am upon these shores; Menelaus, my unhappy\\nhusband, does not yet come. Ah! how life weighs upon me! Oh! ye cruel\\ncrows, who have not devoured my body! But what sweet hope is this that\\nsets my heart a-throb? Oh, Zeus! grant it may not prove a lying one!\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_as Menelaus_). \"To what master does this splendid palace\\nbelong? Will he welcome strangers who have been tried on the billows of\\nthe sea by storm and shipwreck?\"[627]\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"This is the palace of Proteus.\"[628]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Of what Proteus?\"\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Oh! the thrice cursed rascal! how he lies! By the\\ngoddesses, \\'tis ten years since Proteas[629] died.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"What is this shore whither the wind has driven our boat?\"\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"It\\'s Egypt.\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Alas! how far we are from our own country!\"\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. But don\\'t believe that cursed fool. This is Demeter\\'s\\nTemple.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Is Proteus in these parts?\"\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Ah, now, stranger, it must be sea-sickness that makes you\\nso distraught! You have been told that Proteas is dead, and yet you ask\\nif he is in these parts.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"He is no more! Oh! woe! where lie his ashes?\"\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \\'Tis on his tomb you see me sitting.\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. You call an altar a tomb! Beware of the rope!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"And why remain sitting on this tomb, wrapped in this long\\nveil, oh, stranger lady?\"[630]\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"They want to force me to marry a son of Proteus.\"\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Ah! wretch, why tell such shameful lies? Stranger, this is\\na rascal who has slipped in amongst us women to rob us of our trinkets.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS (_to Seventh Woman_) \"Shout! load me with your insults, for\\nlittle care I.\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Who is the old woman who reviles you, stranger lady?\"\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"\\'Tis Theonoé, the daughter of Proteus.\"\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. I! Why, my name\\'s Critylla, the daughter of\\nAntitheus,[631] of the deme of Gargettus;[632] as for you, you are a\\nrogue.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"Your entreaties are vain. Never shall I wed your brother;\\nnever shall I betray the faith I owe my husband Menelaus, who is fighting\\nbefore Troy.\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"What are you saying? Turn your face towards me.\"\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"I dare not; my cheeks show the marks of the insults I have\\nbeen forced to suffer.\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES \"Oh! great gods! I cannot speak, for very emotion.... Ah! what\\ndo I see? Who are you?\"\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"And you, what is your name? for my surprise is as great as\\nyours.\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Are you Grecian or born in this country?\"\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"I am Grecian. But now your name, what is it?\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Oh! how you resemble Helen!\"\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. And you Menelaus, if I can judge by those pot-herbs.[633]\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"You are not mistaken, \\'tis that unfortunate mortal who stands\\nbefore you.\"\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"Ah! how you have delayed coming to your wife\\'s arms! Press\\nme to your heart, throw your arms about me, for I wish to cover you with\\nkisses. Carry me away, carry me away, quick, quick, far, very far from\\nhere.\"\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. By the goddesses, woe to him who would carry you away! I\\nshould thrash him with my torch.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Do you propose to prevent me from taking my wife, the\\ndaughter of Tyndareus, to Sparta?\"\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN You seem to me to be a cunning rascal too; you are in\\ncollusion with this man, and \\'twas not for nothing that you kept babbling\\nabout Egypt. But the hour for punishment has come; here is the magistrate\\ncome with his archer.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. This grows awkward. Let me hide myself.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. And what is to become of me, poor unfortunate man?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Be at ease. I shall never abandon you, as long as I draw\\nbreath and one of my numberless artifices remains untried.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. The fish has not bitten this time.\\n\\nTHE PRYTANIS. Is this the rascal of whom Clisthenes told us? Why are you\\ntrying to make yourself so small? Archer, arrest him, fasten him to the\\npost, then take up your position there and keep guard over him. Let none\\napproach him. A sound lash with your whip for him who attempts to break\\nthe order.\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Excellent, for just now a rogue almost took him from me.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Prytanis, in the name of that hand which you know so well\\nhow to bend, when money is placed in it, grant me a slight favour before\\nI die.\\n\\nPRYTANIS. What favour?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Order the archer to strip me before lashing me to the post;\\nthe crows, when they make their meal on the poor old man, would laugh too\\nmuch at this robe and head-dress.\\n\\nPRYTANIS. \\'Tis in that gear that you must be exposed by order of the\\nSenate, so that your crime may be patent to the passers-by.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! cursed robe, the cause of all my misfortune! My last\\nhope is thus destroyed!\\n\\nCHORUS. Let us now devote ourselves to the sports which the women are\\naccustomed to celebrate here, when time has again brought round the\\nmighty Mysteries of the great goddesses, the sacred days which\\nPauson[634] himself honours by fasting and would wish feast to succeed\\nfeast, that he might keep them all holy. Spring forward with a light\\nstep, whirling in mazy circles; let your hands interlace, let the eager\\nand rapid dancers sway to the music and glance on every side as they\\nmove. Let the chorus sing likewise and praise the Olympian gods in their\\npious transport.\\n\\n\\'Tis wrong to suppose that, because I am a woman and in this Temple, I am\\ngoing to speak ill of men; but since we want something fresh, we are\\ngoing through the rhythmic steps of the round dance for the first time.\\n\\nStart off while you sing to the god of the lyre and to the chaste goddess\\narmed with the bow. Hail! thou god who flingest thy darts so far,[635]\\ngrant us the victory! The homage of our song is also due to Heré, the\\ngoddess of marriage, who interests herself in every chorus and guards the\\napproach to the nuptial couch. I also pray Hermes, the god of the\\nshepherds, and Pan and the beloved Graces to bestow a benevolent smile\\nupon our songs.\\n\\nLet us lead off anew, let us double our zeal during our solemn days, and\\nespecially let us observe a close fast; let us form fresh measures that\\nkeep good time, and may our songs resound to the very heavens. Do thou,\\noh divine Bacchus, who art crowned with ivy, direct our chorus; \\'tis to\\nthee that both my hymns and my dances are dedicated; oh, Evius, oh,\\nBromius,[636] oh, thou son of Semelé, oh, Bacchus, who delightest to\\nmingle with the dear choruses of the nymphs upon the mountains, and who\\nrepeatest, while dancing with them, the sacred hymn, Evius, Evius, Evoe.\\nEcho, the nymph of Cithaeron returns thy words, which resound beneath the\\ndark vaults of the thick foliage and in the midst of the rocks of the\\nforest; the ivy enlaces thy brow with its tendrils charged with flowers.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN ARCHER.[637] You shall stay here in the open air to wail.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Archer, I adjure you.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. \\'Tis labour lost.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Loosen the wedge a little.[638]\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Aye, certainly.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! by the gods! why, you are driving it in tighter.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Is that enough?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! la, la! oh! la, la! May the plague take you!\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Silence! you cursed old wretch! I am going to get a mat to lie\\nupon, so as to watch you close at hand at my ease.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Ah! what exquisite pleasures Euripides is securing for me!\\nBut, oh, ye gods! oh, Zeus the Deliverer, all is not yet lost! I don\\'t\\nbelieve him the man to break his word; I just caught sight of him\\nappearing in the form of Perseus, and he told me with a mysterious sign\\nto turn myself into Andromeda. And in truth am I not really bound? \\'Tis\\ncertain, then, that he is coming to my rescue; for otherwise he would not\\nhave steered his flight this way.[639]\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_as Perseus_). Oh Nymphs, ye virgins who are dear to me, how\\nam I to approach him? how can I escape the sight of this Scythian? And\\nEcho, thou who reignest in the inmost recesses of the caves, oh! favour\\nmy cause and permit me to approach my spouse.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS (_as Andromeda_).[640] A pitiless ruffian has chained up the\\nmost unfortunate of mortal maids. Alas! I had barely escaped the filthy\\nclaws of an old fury, when another mischance overtook me! This Scythian\\ndoes not take his eye off me and he has exposed me as food for the crows.\\nAlas! what is to become of me, alone here and without friends! I am not\\nseen mingling in the dances nor in the games of my companions, but\\nheavily loaded with fetters I am given over to the voracity of a\\nGlaucetes.[641] Sing no bridal hymn for me, oh women, but rather the hymn\\nof captivity, and in tears. Ah! how I suffer! great gods! how I suffer!\\nAlas! alas! and through my own relatives too![642] My misery would make\\nTartarus dissolve into tears! Alas! in my terrible distress, I implore\\nthe mortal who first shaved me and depilated me, then dressed me in this\\nlong robe, and then sent me to this Temple into the midst of the women,\\nto save me. Oh, thou pitiless Fate! I am then accursed, great gods! Ah!\\nwho would not be moved at the sight of the appalling tortures under which\\nI succumb? Would that the blazing shaft of the lightning would wither...\\nthis barbarian for me! (_pointing to the Scythian archer_) for the\\nimmortal light has no further charm for my eyes since I have been\\ndescending the shortest path to the dead, tied up, strangled, and\\nmaddened with pain.\\n\\nEURIPIDES (as _Echo_). Hail! beloved girl. As for your father, Cepheus,\\nwho has exposed you in this guise, may the gods annihilate him.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS (_as Andromeda_). And who are you whom my misfortunes have\\nmoved to pity?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I am Echo, the nymph who repeats all she hears. \\'Tis I, who\\nlast year lent my help to Euripides in this very place.[643] But, my\\nchild, give yourself up to the sad laments that belong to your pitiful\\ncondition.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. And you will repeat them?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I will not fail you. Begin.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"Oh! thou divine Night! how slowly thy chariot threads its\\nway through the starry vault, across the sacred realms of the Air and\\nmighty Olympus.\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Mighty Olympus.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"Why is it necessary that Andromeda should have all the woes\\nfor her share?\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. For her share.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. \"Sad death!\"\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Sad death!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. You weary me, old babbler.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Old babbler.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Oh! you are too unbearable.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Unbearable.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Friend, let me talk by myself. Do please let me. Come,\\nthat\\'s enough.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. That\\'s enough.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Go and hang yourself!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Go and hang yourself!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. What a plague!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What a plague!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Cursed brute!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Cursed brute!\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Beware of blows!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Beware of blows!\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Hullo! what are you jabbering about?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. What are you jabbering about?\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. I go to call the Prytanes.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. I go to call the Prytanes.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. This is odd!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. This is odd!\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Whence comes this voice?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Whence comes this voice.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Ah! beware!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Ah! beware!\\n\\nSCYTHIAN (_to Mnesilochus_). Are you mocking me?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Are you mocking me?\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. No, \\'tis this woman, who stands near you.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Who stands near you.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Where is the hussy? Ah! she is escaping! Whither, whither are\\nyou escaping?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Whither, whither are you escaping?\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. You shall not get away.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You shall not get away.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. You are chattering still?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You are chattering still?\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Stop the hussy.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Stop the hussy.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. What a babbling, cursed woman!\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_as Perseus_). \"Oh! ye gods! to what barbarian land has my\\nswift flight taken me? I am Perseus, who cleaves the plains of the air\\nwith my winged feet, and I am carrying the Gorgon\\'s head to Argos.\"\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. What, are you talking about the head of Gorgos,[644] the\\nscribe?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. No, I am speaking of the head of the Gorgon.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Why, yes! of Gorgus!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"But what do I behold? A young maiden, beautiful as the\\nimmortals, chained to this rock like a vessel in port?\"\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Take pity on me, oh, stranger! I am so unhappy and\\ndistraught! Free me from these bonds.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Don\\'t you talk! a curse upon your impudence! you are going to\\ndie, and yet you will be chattering!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Oh! virgin! I take pity on your chains.\"\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. But this is no virgin; \\'tis an old rogue, a cheat and a thief.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You have lost your wits, Scythian. This is Andromeda, the\\ndaughter of Cepheus.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. But just look at this tool; is that like a woman?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Give me your hand, that I may descend near this young maiden.\\nEach man has his own particular weakness; as for me I am aflame with love\\nfor this virgin.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Oh! I\\'m not jealous; and as he has his back turned this way,\\nwhy, I make no objection to your pedicating him.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Ah! let me release her, and hasten to join her on the bridal\\ncouch.\"\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. If this old man instils you with such ardent concupiscence,\\nwhy, you can bore through the plank, and so get at his behind.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. No, I will break his bonds.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Beware of my lash!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. No matter.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. This blade shall cut off your head.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. \"Ah! what can be done? what arguments can I use? This savage\\nwill understand nothing! The newest and most cunning fancies are a dead\\nletter to the ignorant. Let us invent some artifice to fit in with his\\ncoarse nature.\"\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. I can see the rascal is trying to outwit me.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. Ah! Perseus! remember in what condition you are leaving me.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Are you wanting to feel my lash again!\\n\\nCHORUS.\\n\\nOh! Pallas, who art fond of dances, hasten hither at my call. Oh! thou\\nchaste virgin, the protectress of Athens, I call thee in accordance with\\nthe sacred rites, thee, whose evident protection we adore and who keepest\\nthe keys of our city in thy hands. Do thou appear, thou whose just hatred\\nhas overturned our tyrants. The womenfolk are calling thee; hasten hither\\nat their bidding along with Peace, who shall restore the festivals. And\\nye, august goddesses,[645] display a smiling and propitious countenance\\nto our gaze; come into your sacred grove, the entry to which is forbidden\\nto men; \\'tis there in the midst of sacred orgies that we contemplate your\\ndivine features. Come, appear, we pray it of you, oh, venerable\\nThesmophoriae! If you have ever answered our appeal, oh! come into our\\nmidst.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Women, if you will be reconciled with me, I am willing, and I\\nundertake never to say anything ill of you in future. Those are my\\nproposals for peace.\\n\\nCHORUS. And what impels you to make these overtures?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. This unfortunate man, who is chained to the post, is my\\nfather-in-law; if you will restore him to me, you will have no more cause\\nto complain of me; but if not, I shall reveal your pranks to your\\nhusbands when they return from the war.\\n\\nCHORUS. We accept peace, but there is this barbarian whom you must buy\\nover.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. That\\'s my business. (_He returns as an old woman and is\\naccompanied by a dancing-girl and a flute-girl._) Come, my little wench,\\nbear in mind what I told you on the road and do it well. Come, go past\\nhim and gird up your robe. And you, you little dear, play us the air of a\\nPersian dance.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. What is this music that makes me so blithe?\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_as an old woman_). Scythian, this young girl is going to\\npractise some dances, which she has to perform at a feast presently.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Very well! let her dance and practise; I won\\'t hinder her. How\\nnimbly she bounds! one might think her a flea on a fleece.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Come, my dear, off with your robe and seat yourself on the\\nScythian\\'s knee; stretch forth your feet to me, that I may take off your\\nslippers.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Ah! yes, seat yourself, my little girl, ah! yes, to be sure.\\nWhat a firm little bosom! \\'tis just like a turnip.\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_to the flute-girl_). An air on the flute, quick! (_To the\\ndancing-girl._) Well! are you still afraid of the Scythian?\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. What beautiful thighs!\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Come! keep still, can\\'t you?\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. \\'Tis altogether a very fine morsel to make a man\\'s cock stand.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. That\\'s so! (_To the dancing-girl._) Resume your dress, it is\\ntime to be going.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Give me a kiss.\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_to the dancing-girl_). Come, give him a kiss.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Oh! oh! oh! my goodness, what soft lips! \\'tis like Attic honey.\\nBut might she not stop with me?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Impossible, archer; good evening.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Oh! oh! old woman, do me this pleasure.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Will you give a drachma?\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Aye, that I will.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Hand over the money.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. I have not got it, but take my quiver in pledge.\\n\\nEURIPIDES. You will bring her back?\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Follow me, my beautiful child. And you, old woman, just keep\\nguard over this man. But what is your name?\\n\\nEURIPIDES. Artemisia. Can you remember that name?\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Artemuxia.[646] Good!\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_aside_). Hermes, god of cunning, receive my thanks!\\neverything is turning out for the best. (_To the Scythian._) As for you,\\nfriend, take away this girl, quick. (_Exit the Scythian with the\\ndancing-girl._) Now let me loose his bonds. (_To Mnesilochus._) And you,\\ndirectly I have released you, take to your legs and run off full tilt to\\nyour home to find your wife and children.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. I shall not fail in that as soon as I am free.\\n\\nEURIPIDES (_releases Mnesilochus_). There! \\'Tis done. Come, fly, before\\nthe archer lays his hand on you again.\\n\\nMNESILOCHUS. That\\'s just what I am doing. [_Exit with Euripides._\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Ah! old woman! what a charming little girl! Not at all the\\nprude, and so obliging! Eh! where is the old woman? Ah! I am undone! And\\nthe old man, where is he? Hi! old woman! old woman! Ah! but this is a\\ndirty trick! Artemuxia! she has tricked me, that\\'s what the little old\\nwoman has done! Get clean out of my sight, you cursed quiver! (_Picks it\\nup and throws it across the stage._) Ha! you are well named quiver, for\\nyou have made me quiver indeed.[647] Oh! what\\'s to be done? Where is the\\nold woman then? Artemuxia!\\n\\nCHORUS. Are you asking for the old woman who carried the lyre?\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Yes, yes; have you seen her?\\n\\nCHORUS. She has gone that way along with an old man.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Dressed in a long robe?\\n\\nCHORUS. Yes; run quick, and you will overtake them.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Ah! rascally old woman! Which way has she fled? Artemuxia!\\n\\nCHORUS. Straight on; follow your nose. But, hi! where are you running to\\nnow? Come back, you are going exactly the wrong way.\\n\\nSCYTHIAN. Ye gods! ye gods! and all this while Artemuxia is escaping.\\n[_Exit running._\\n\\nCHORUS. Go your way! and a pleasant journey to you! But our sports have\\nlasted long enough; it is time for each of us to be off home; and may the\\ntwo goddesses reward us for our labours!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFINIS OF \"THE THESMOPHORIAZUSAE\"', 'over the door. Time: a little after midnight.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTHE ECCLESIAZUSAE\\n\\nor\\n\\nWomen In Council\\n\\n\\nPRAXAGORA (_enters carrying a lamp in her hand_). Oh! thou shining light\\nof my earthenware lamp, from this high spot shalt thou look abroad. Oh!\\nlamp, I will tell thee thine origin and thy future; \\'tis the rapid whirl\\nof the potter\\'s wheel that has lent thee thy shape, and thy wick\\ncounterfeits the glory of the sun;[648] mayst thou send the agreed signal\\nflashing afar! In thee alone do we confide, and thou art worthy, for thou\\nart near us when we practise the various postures in which Aphrodité\\ndelights upon our couches, and none dream even in the midst of her sports\\nof seeking to avoid thine eye that watches our swaying bodies. Thou alone\\nshinest into the depths of our most secret charms, and with thy flame\\ndost singe the hairy growth of our privates. If we open some cellar\\nstored with fruits and wine, thou art our companion, and never dost thou\\nbetray or reveal to a neighbour the secrets thou hast learned about us.\\nTherefore thou shalt know likewise the whole of the plot that I have\\nplanned with my friends, the women, at the festival of the\\nScirophoria.[649]\\n\\nI see none of those I was expecting, though dawn approaches; the Assembly\\nis about to gather and we must take our seats in spite of\\nPhyromachus,[650] who forsooth would say, \"It is meet the women sit apart\\nand hidden from the eyes of the men.\" Why, have they not been able then\\nto procure the false beards that they must wear, or to steal their\\nhusbands cloaks? Ah! I see a light approaching; let us draw somewhat\\naside, for fear it should be a man.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. Let us start, it is high time; as we left our dwellings, the\\ncock was crowing for the second time.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. And I have spent the whole night waiting for you. But come,\\nlet us call our neighbour by scratching at her door; and gently too, so\\nthat her husband may hear nothing.\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. I was putting on my shoes, when I heard you scratching, for\\nI was not asleep, so there! Oh! my dear, my husband (he is a Salaminian)\\nnever left me an instant\\'s peace, but was at me, for ever at me, all\\nnight long, so that it was only just now that I was able to filch his\\ncloak.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. I see Clinareté coming too, along with Sostraté and their\\nnext-door neighbour Philaeneté.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Hurry yourselves then, for Glycé has sworn that the last comer\\nshall forfeit three measures of wine and a _choenix_ of pease.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. Don\\'t you see Melisticé, the wife of Smicythion, hurrying\\nhither in her great shoes? Methinks she is the only one of us all who has\\nhad no trouble in getting rid of her husband.\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. And can\\'t you see Gusistraté, the tavern-keeper\\'s wife,\\nwith a lamp in her hand, and the wives of Philodoretus and Chaeretades?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. I can see many others too, indeed the whole of the flower of\\nAthens.\\n\\nTHIRD WOMAN. Oh! my dear, I have had such trouble in getting away! My\\nhusband ate such a surfeit of sprats last evening that he was coughing\\nand choking the whole night long.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Take your seats, and, since you are all gathered here at last,\\nlet us see if what we decided on at the feast of the Scirophoria has been\\nduly done.\\n\\nFOURTH WOMAN. Yes. Firstly, as agreed, I have let the hair under my\\narmpits grow thicker than a bush; furthermore, whilst my husband was at\\nthe Assembly, I rubbed myself from head to foot with oil and then stood\\nthe whole day long in the sun.[651]\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. So did I. I began by throwing away my razor, so that I might\\nget quite hairy, and no longer resemble a woman.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Have you the beards that we had all to get ourselves for the\\nAssembly?\\n\\nFOURTH WOMAN. Yea, by Hecaté! Is this not a fine one?\\n\\nFIFTH WOMAN. Aye, much finer than Epicrates\\'.[652]\\n\\nPRAXAGORA (_to the other women_). And you?\\n\\nFOURTH WOMAN. Yes, yes; look, they all nod assent.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. I see that you have got all the rest too, Spartan shoes,\\nstaffs and men\\'s cloaks, as \\'twas arranged.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. I have brought Lamias\\'[653] club, which I stole from him\\nwhile he slept.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. What, the club that makes him puff and pant with its weight?\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. By Zeus the Deliverer, if he had the skin of Argus, he would\\nknow better than any other how to shepherd the popular herd.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. But come, let us finish what has yet to be done, while the\\nstars are still shining; the Assembly, at which we mean to be present,\\nwill open at dawn.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. Good; you must take up your place at the foot of the\\nplatform and facing the Prytanes.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. I have brought this with me to card during the Assembly.\\n(_She shows some wool._)\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. During the Assembly, wretched woman?\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. Aye, by Artemis! shall I hear any less well if I am doing a\\nbit of carding? My little ones are all but naked.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Think of her wanting to card! whereas we must not let anyone\\nsee the smallest part of our bodies.[654] \\'Twould be a fine thing if one\\nof us, in the midst of the discussion, rushed on to the speaker\\'s\\nplatform and, flinging her cloak aside, showed her hairy privates. If, on\\nthe other hand, we are the first to take our seats closely muffled in our\\ncloaks, none will know us. Let us fix these beards on our chins, so that\\nthey spread all over our bosoms. How can we fail then to be mistaken for\\nmen? Agyrrhius has deceived everyone, thanks to the beard of\\nPronomus;[655] yet he was no better than a woman, and you see how he now\\nholds the first position in the city. Thus, I adjure you by this day that\\nis about to dawn, let us dare to copy him and let us be clever enough to\\npossess ourselves of the management of affairs. Let us save the vessel of\\nState, which just at present none seems able either to sail or row.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. But where shall we find orators in an Assembly of women?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Nothing simpler. Is it not said, that the cleverest speakers\\nare those who submit themselves oftenest to men? Well, thanks to the\\ngods, we are that by nature.\\n\\nSIXTH WOMAN. There\\'s no doubt of that; but the worst of it is our\\ninexperience.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. That\\'s the very reason we are gathered here, in order to\\nprepare the speech we must make in the Assembly. Hasten, therefore, all\\nyou who know aught of speaking, to fix on your beards.\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Oh! you great fool! is there ever a one among us cannot\\nuse her tongue?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Come, look sharp, on with your beard and become a man. As for\\nme, I will do the same in case I should have a fancy for getting on to\\nthe platform. Here are the chaplets.\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. Oh! great gods! my dear Praxagora, do look here! Is it not\\nlaughable?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. How laughable?\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. Our beards look like broiled cuttle-fishes.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. The priest is bringing in--the cat.[656] Make ready, make\\nready! Silence, Ariphrades![657] Go and take your seat. Now, who wishes\\nto speak?\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. I do.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Then put on this chaplet[658] and success be with you.\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. There, \\'tis done!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Well then! begin.\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Before drinking?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Hah! she wants to drink![659]\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Why, what else is the meaning of this chaplet?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Get you hence! you would probably have played us this trick\\nalso before the people.\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Well! don\\'t the men drink then in the Assembly?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Now she\\'s telling us the men drink!\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Aye, by Artemis, and neat wine too. That\\'s why their\\ndecrees breathe of drunkenness and madness. And why libations, why so\\nmany ceremonies, if wine plays no part in them? Besides, they abuse each\\nother like drunken men, and you can see the archers dragging more than\\none uproarious drunkard out of the Agora.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Go back to your seat, you are wandering.\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Ah! I should have done better not to have muffled myself\\nin this beard; my throat\\'s afire and I feel I shall die of thirst.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Who else wishes to speak?\\n\\nEIGHTH WOMAN. I do.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Quick then, take the chaplet, for time\\'s running short. Try to\\nspeak worthily, let your language be truly manly, and lean on your staff\\nwith dignity.\\n\\nEIGHTH WOMAN. I had rather have seen one of your regular orators giving\\nyou wise advice; but, as that is not to be, it behoves me to break\\nsilence; I cannot, for my part indeed, allow the tavern-keepers to fill\\nup their wine-pits with water.[660] No, by the two goddesses....\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. What? by the two goddesses![661] Wretched woman, where are\\nyour senses?\\n\\nEIGHTH WOMAN. Eh! what?... I have not asked you for a drink!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. No, but you want to pass for a man, and you swear by the two\\ngoddesses. Otherwise \\'twas very well.\\n\\nEIGHTH WOMAN. Well then. By Apollo....\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Stop! All these details of language must be adjusted; else it\\nis quite useless to go to the Assembly.\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. Pass me the chaplet; I wish to speak again, for I think I\\nhave got hold of something good. You women who are listening to me....\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Women again; why, wretched creature, \\'tis men that you are\\naddressing.\\n\\nSEVENTH WOMAN. \\'Tis the fault of Epigonus;[662] I caught sight of him\\nover yonder, and I thought I was speaking to women.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Come, withdraw and remain seated in future. I am going to take\\nthis chaplet myself and speak in your name. May the gods grant success to\\nmy plans!\\n\\nMy country is as dear to me as it is to you, and I groan, I am grieved at\\nall that is happening in it. Scarcely one in ten of those who rule it is\\nhonest, and all the others are bad. If you appoint fresh chiefs, they\\nwill do still worse. It is hard to correct your peevish humour; you fear\\nthose who love you and throw yourselves at the feet of those who betray\\nyou. There was a time when we had no assemblies, and then we all thought\\nAgyrrhius a dishonest man;[663] now they are established, he who gets\\nmoney thinks everything is as it should be, and he who does not, declares\\nall who sell their votes to be worthy of death.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. By Aphrodité, that is well spoken.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Why, wretched woman, you have actually called upon Aphrodité.\\nOh! what a fine thing \\'twould have been had you said that in the\\nAssembly!\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. I should never have done that!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Well, mind you don\\'t fall into the habit.--When we were\\ndiscussing the alliance,[664] it seemed as though it were all over with\\nAthens if it fell through. No sooner was it made than we were vexed and\\nangry, and the orator who had caused its adoption was compelled to seek\\nsafety in flight.[665] Is there talk of equipping a fleet? The poor man\\nsays, yes, but the rich citizen and the countryman say, no. You were\\nangered against the Corinthians and they with you; now they are well\\ndisposed towards you, be so towards them. As a rule the Argives are dull,\\nbut the Argive Hieronymus[666] is a distinguished chief. Herein lies a\\nspark of hope; but Thrasybulus is far from Athens[667] and you do not\\nrecall him.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. Oh! what a brilliant man!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. That\\'s better! that\\'s fitting applause.--Citizens, \\'tis you\\nwho are the cause of all this trouble. You vote yourselves salaries out\\nof the public funds and care only for your own personal interests; hence\\nthe State limps along like Aesimus.[668] But if you hearken to me, you\\nwill be saved. I assert that the direction of affairs must be handed over\\nto the women, for \\'tis they who have charge and look after our\\nhouseholds.\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. Very good, very good, \\'tis perfect! Say on, say on.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. They are worth more than you are, as I shall prove. First of\\nall they wash all their wool in warm water, according to the ancient\\npractice; you will never see them changing their method. Ah! if Athens\\nonly acted thus, if it did not take delight in ceaseless innovations,\\nwould not its happiness be assured? Then the women sit down to cook, as\\nthey always did; they carry things on their head as was their wont; they\\nkeep the Thesmophoria, as they have ever done; they knead their cakes\\njust as they used to; they make their husbands angry as they have always\\ndone; they receive their lovers in their houses as was their constant\\ncustom; they buy dainties as they always did; they love unmixed wine as\\nwell as ever; they delight in being loved just as much as they always\\nhave. Let us therefore hand Athens over to them without endless\\ndiscussions, without bothering ourselves about what they will do; let us\\nsimply hand them over the power, remembering that they are mothers and\\nwill therefore spare the blood of our soldiers; besides, who will know\\nbetter than a mother how to forward provisions to the front? Woman is\\nadept at getting money for herself and will not easily let herself be\\ndeceived; she understands deceit too well herself. I omit a thousand\\nother advantages. Take my advice and you will live in perfect happiness.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. How beautiful this is, my dearest Praxagora, how clever! But\\nwhere, pray, did you learn all these pretty things?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. When the countryfolk were seeking refuge in the city,[669] I\\nlived on the Pnyx with my husband, and there I learnt to speak through\\nlistening to the orators.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. Then, dear, \\'tis not astonishing that you are so eloquent\\nand clever; henceforward you shall be our leader, so put your great ideas\\ninto execution. But if Cephalus[670] belches forth insults against you,\\nwhat answer will you give him in the Assembly?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. I shall say that he drivels.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. But all the world knows that.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. I shall furthermore say that he is a raving madman.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. There\\'s nobody who does not know it.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. That he, as excellent a statesman as he is, is a clumsy\\ntinker.[671]\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. And if the blear-eyed Neoclides[672] comes to insult you?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. To him I shall say, \"Go and look at a dog\\'s backside\".[673]\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. And if they fly at you?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Oh! I shall shake them off as best I can; never fear, I know\\nhow to use this tool.[674]\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. But there is one thing we don\\'t think of. If the archers\\ndrag you away, what will you do?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. With my arms akimbo like this, I will never, never let myself\\nbe taken round the middle.\\n\\nFIRST WOMAN. If they seize you, we will bid them let you go.\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. That\\'s the best way. But how are we going to lift up our\\narm[675] in the Assembly, we, who only know how to lift our legs in the\\nact of love?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. \\'Tis difficult; yet it must be done, and the arm shown naked\\nto the shoulder in order to vote. Quick now, put on these tunics and\\nthese Laconian shoes, as you see the men do each time they go to the\\nAssembly or for a walk. Then this done, fix on your beards, and when they\\nare arranged in the best way possible, dress yourselves in the cloaks you\\nhave abstracted from your husbands; finally start off leaning on your\\nstaffs and singing some old man\\'s song as the villagers do.\\n\\nSECOND WOMAN. Well spoken; and let us hurry to get to the Pnyx before the\\nwomen from the country, for they will no doubt not fail to come there.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Quick, quick, for \\'tis all the custom that those who are not\\nat the Pnyx early in the morning, return home empty-handed.\\n\\nCHORUS. Move forward, citizens, move forward; let us not forget to give\\nourselves this name and may that of _woman_ never slip out of our mouths;\\nwoe to us, if it were discovered that we had laid such a plot in the\\ndarkness of night. Let us go to the Assembly then, fellow-citizens; for\\nthe Thesmothetae have declared that only those who arrive at daybreak\\nwith haggard eye and covered with dust, without having snatched time to\\neat anything but a snack of garlic-pickle, shall alone receive the\\ntriobolus. Walk up smartly, Charitimides,[676] Smicythus and Draces, and\\ndo not fail in any point of your part; let us first demand our fee and\\nthen vote for all that may perchance be useful for our partisans.... Ah!\\nwhat am I saying? I meant to say, for our fellow-citizens. Let us drive\\naway these men of the city,[677] who used to stay at home and chatter\\nround the table in the days when only an obolus was paid, whereas now one\\nis stifled by the crowds at the Pnyx.[678] No! during the Archonship of\\ngenerous Myronides,[679] none would have dared to let himself be paid for\\nthe trouble he spent over public business; each one brought his own meal\\nof bread, a couple of onions, three olives and some wine in a little\\nwine-skin. But nowadays we run here to earn the three obols, for the\\ncitizen has become as mercenary as the stonemason. (_The Chorus marches\\naway._)\\n\\nBLEPYRUS (_husband of Praxagora_). What does this mean? My wife has\\nvanished! it is nearly daybreak and she does not return! Wanting to\\nrelieve myself, lo! I awake and hunt in the darkness for my shoes and my\\ncloak; but grope where I will, I cannot find them. Meanwhile my need grew\\neach moment more urgent and I had only just time to seize my wife\\'s\\nlittle mantle and her Persian slippers. But where shall I find a spot\\nsuitable for my purpose. Bah! One place is as good as another at\\nnight-time, for no one will see me. Ah! what fatal folly \\'twas to take a\\nwife at my age, and how I could thrash myself for having acted so\\nfoolishly! \\'Tis a certainty she\\'s not gone out for any honest purpose.\\nHowever, that\\'s not our present business.\\n\\nA MAN. Who\\'s there? Is that not my neighbour Blepyrus? Why, yes, \\'tis\\nhimself and no other. Tell me, what\\'s all that yellow about you? Can it\\nbe Cinesias[680] who has befouled you so?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. No, no, I only slipped on my wife\\'s tunic[681] to come out in.\\n\\nMAN. And where is your cloak?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. I cannot tell you, for I hunted for it vainly on the bed.\\n\\nMAN. And why did you not ask your wife for it?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Ah! why indeed! because she is not in the house; she has run\\naway, and I greatly fear that she may be doing me an ill turn.\\n\\nMAN. But, by Posidon, \\'tis the same with myself. My wife has disappeared\\nwith my cloak, and what is still worse, with my shoes as well, for I\\ncannot find them anywhere.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Nor can I my Laconian shoes; but as I had urgent need, I popped\\nmy feet into these slippers, so as not to soil my blanket, which is quite\\nnew.\\n\\nMAN. What does it mean? Can some friend have invited her to a feast?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. I expect so, for she does not generally misconduct herself, as\\nfar as I know.\\n\\nMAN. Come, I say, you seem to be making ropes. Are you never going to be\\ndone? As for myself, I would like to go to the Assembly, and it is time\\nto start, but the thing is to find my cloak, for I have only one.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. I am going to have a look too, when I have done; but I really\\nthink there must be a wild pear obstructing my rectum.\\n\\nMAN. Is it the one which Thrasybulus spoke about to the\\nLacedaemonians?[682]\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Oh! oh! oh! how the obstruction holds! Whatever am I to do?\\n\\'Tis not merely for the present that I am frightened; but when I have\\neaten, where is it to find an outlet now? This cursed Achradusian\\nfellow[683] has bolted the door. Let a doctor be fetched; but which is\\nthe cleverest in this branch of the science? Amynon?[684] Perhaps he\\nwould not come. Ah! Antithenes![685] Let him be brought to me, cost what\\nit will. To judge by his noisy sighs, that man knows what a rump wants,\\nwhen in urgent need. Oh! venerated Ilithyia![686] I shall burst unless\\nthe door gives way. Have pity! pity! Let me not become the night-stool of\\nthe comic poets.[687]\\n\\nCHREMES. Hi! friend, what are you after there? Easing yourself!\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Oh! there! it is over and I can get up again at last.\\n\\nCHREMES. What\\'s this? You have your wife\\'s tunic on.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Aye, \\'twas the first thing that came to my hand in the\\ndarkness. But where do you hail from?\\n\\nCHREMES. From the Assembly.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Is it already over then?\\n\\nCHREMES. Certainly.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Why, it is scarcely daylight.\\n\\nCHREMES. I did laugh, ye gods, at the vermilion rope-marks that were to\\nbe seen all about the Assembly.[688]\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Did you get the triobolus?\\n\\nCHREMES. Would it had so pleased the gods! but I arrived just too late,\\nand am quite ashamed of it; I bring back nothing but this empty wallet.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. But why is that?\\n\\nCHREMES. There was a crowd, such as has never been seen at the Pnyx, and\\nthe folk looked pale and wan, like so many shoemakers, so white were they\\nin hue; both I and many another had to go without the triobolus.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Then if I went now, I should get nothing.\\n\\nCHREMES. No, certainly not, nor even had you gone at the second\\ncock-crow.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Oh! what a misfortune! Oh, Antilochus![689] no triobolus! Even\\ndeath would be better! I am undone! But what can have attracted such a\\ncrowd at that early hour?\\n\\nCHREMES. The Prytanes started the discussion of measures nearly\\nconcerning the safety of the State; immediately, that blear-eyed fellow,\\nthe son of Neoclides,[690] was the first to mount the platform. Then the\\nfolk shouted with their loudest voice, \"What! he dares to speak, and\\nthat, too, when the safety of the State is concerned, and he a man who\\nhas not known how to save even his own eyebrows!\" He, however, shouted\\nlouder than they all, and looking at them asked, \"Why, what ought I to\\nhave done?\"\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Pound together garlic and laserpitium juice, add to this\\nmixture some Laconian spurge, and rub it well into the eyelids at night.\\nThat\\'s what I should have answered, had I been there.\\n\\nCHREMES. After him that clever rascal Evaeon[691] began to speak; he was\\nnaked, so far as we all could see, but he declared he had a cloak; he\\npropounded the most popular, the most democratic, doctrines. \"You see,\"\\nhe said, \"I have the greatest need of sixteen drachmae, the cost of a new\\ncloak, my health demands it; nevertheless I wish first to care for that\\nof my fellow-citizens and of my country. If the fullers were to supply\\ntunics to the indigent at the approach of winter, none would be exposed\\nto pleurisy. Let him who has neither beds nor coverlets go to sleep at\\nthe tanners\\' after taking a bath; and if they shut the door in winter,\\nlet them be condemned to give him three goat-skins.\"\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. By Dionysus, a fine, a very fine notion! Not a soul will vote\\nagainst his proposal, especially if he adds that the flour-sellers must\\nsupply the poor with three measures of corn, or else suffer the severest\\npenalties of the law; \\'tis only in this way that Nausicydes[692] can be\\nof any use to us.\\n\\nCHREMES. Then we saw a handsome young man rush into the tribune, he was\\nall pink and white like young Nicias,[693] and he began to say that the\\ndirection of matters should be entrusted to the women; this the crowd of\\nshoemakers[694] began applauding with all their might, while the\\ncountry-folk assailed him with groans.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And, \\'faith, they did well.\\n\\nCHREMES. But they were outnumbered, and the orator shouted louder than\\nthey, saying much good of the women and much ill of you.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And what did he say?\\n\\nCHREMES. First he said you were a rogue...\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And you?\\n\\nCHREMES. Let me speak ... and a thief....\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. I alone?\\n\\nCHREMES. And an informer.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. I alone?\\n\\nCHREMES. Why, no, by the gods! all of us.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And who avers the contrary?\\n\\nCHREMES. He maintained that women were both clever and thrifty, that they\\nnever divulged the Mysteries of Demeter, while you and I go about\\nbabbling incessantly about whatever happens at the Senate.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. By Hermes, he was not lying!\\n\\nCHREMES. Then he added, that the women lend each other clothes, trinkets\\nof gold and silver, drinking-cups, and not before witnesses too, but all\\nby themselves, and that they return everything with exactitude without\\never cheating each other; whereas, according to him, we are ever ready to\\ndeny the loans we have effected.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Aye, by Posidon, and in spite of witnesses.\\n\\nCHREMES. Again, he said that women were not informers, nor did they bring\\nlawsuits, nor hatch conspiracies; in short, he praised the women in every\\npossible manner.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And what was decided?\\n\\nCHREMES. To confide the direction of affairs to them; \\'tis the one and\\nonly innovation that has not yet been tried at Athens.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And it was voted?\\n\\nCHREMES. Yes.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And everything that used to be the men\\'s concern has been given\\nover to the women?\\n\\nCHREMES. You express it exactly.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Thus \\'twill be my wife who will go to the Courts now in my\\nstead.\\n\\nCHREMES. And it will be she who will keep your children in your place.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. I shall no longer have to tire myself out with work from\\ndaybreak onwards?\\n\\nCHREMES. No, \\'twill be the women\\'s business, and you can stop at home and\\ntake your ease.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Well, what I fear for us fellows now is, that, holding the\\nreins of government, they will forcibly compel us ...\\n\\nCHREMES. To do what?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. ... to work them.\\n\\nCHREMES. And if we are not able?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. They will give us no dinner.\\n\\nCHREMES. Well then, do your duty; dinner and love form a double\\nenjoyment.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Ah! but I hate compulsion.\\n\\nCHREMES. But if it be for the public weal, let us resign ourselves. \\'Tis\\nan old saying, that our absurdest and maddest decrees always somehow turn\\nout for our good. May it be so in this case, oh gods, oh venerable\\nPallas! But I must be off; so, good-bye to you!\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Good-bye, Chremes.\\n\\nCHORUS. March along, go forward. Is there some man following us? Turn\\nround, examine everywhere and keep a good look-out; be on your guard\\nagainst every trick, for they might spy on us from behind. Let us make as\\nmuch noise as possible as we tramp. It would be a disgrace for all of us\\nif we allowed ourselves to be caught in this deed by the men. Come, wrap\\nyourselves up well, and search both right and left, so that no mischance\\nmay happen to us. Let us hasten our steps; here we are close to the\\nmeeting-place, whence we started for the Assembly, and here is the house\\nof our leader, the author of this bold scheme, which is now decreed by\\nall the citizens. Let us not lose a moment in taking off our false\\nbeards, for we might be recognized and denounced. Let us stand under the\\nshadow of this wall; let us glance round sharply with our eye to beware\\nof surprises, while we quickly resume our ordinary dress. Ah! here is our\\nleader, returning from the Assembly. Hasten to relieve your chins of\\nthese flowing manes. Look at your comrades yonder; they have already made\\nthemselves women again some while ago.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Friends, success has crowned our plans. But off with these\\ncloaks and these boots quick, before any man sees you; unbuckle the\\nLaconian straps and get rid of your staffs; and do you help them with\\ntheir toilet. As for myself, I am going to slip quietly into the house\\nand replace my husband\\'s cloak and other gear where I took them from,\\nbefore he can suspect anything.\\n\\nCHORUS. There! \\'tis done according to your bidding. Now tell us how we\\ncan be of service to you, so that we may show you our obedience, for we\\nhave never seen a cleverer woman than you.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Wait! I only wish to use the power given me in accordance with\\nyour wishes; for, in the market-place, in the midst of the shouts and\\ndanger, I appreciated your indomitable courage.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Eh, Praxagora! where do you come from?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. How does that concern you, friend?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Why, greatly! what a silly question!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. You don\\'t think I have come from a lover\\'s?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. No, perhaps not from only one.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. You can make yourself sure of that.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And how?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. You can see whether my hair smells of perfume.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. What? cannot a woman possibly be loved without perfume, eh!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. The gods forfend, as far as I am concerned.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Why did you go off at early dawn with my cloak?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. A companion, a friend who was in labour, had sent to fetch me.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Could you not have told me?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Oh, my dear, would you have me caring nothing for a poor woman\\nin that plight?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. A word would have been enough. There\\'s something behind all\\nthis.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. No, I call the goddesses to witness! I went running off; the\\npoor woman who summoned me begged me to come, whatever might betide.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And why did you not take your mantle? Instead of that, you\\ncarry off mine, you throw your dress upon the bed and you leave me as the\\ndead are left, bar the chaplets and perfumes.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. \\'Twas cold, and I am frail and delicate; I took your cloak for\\ngreater warmth, leaving you thoroughly warm yourself beneath your\\ncoverlets.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And my shoes and staff, those too went off with you?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. I was afraid they might rob me of the cloak, and so, to look\\nlike a man, I put on your shoes and walked with a heavy tread and struck\\nthe stones with your staff.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. D\\'you know you have made us lose a _sextary_ of wheat, which I\\nshould have bought with the _triobolus_ of the Assembly?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Be comforted, for she had a boy.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Who? the Assembly?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. No, no, the woman I helped. But has the Assembly taken place\\nthen?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Did I not tell you of it yesterday?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. True; I remember now.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And don\\'t you know the decrees that have been voted?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. No indeed.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Go to! you can eat cuttle-fish[695] now, for \\'tis said the\\ngovernment is handed over to you.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. To do what--to spin?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. No, that you may rule ...\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. What?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. ... over all public business.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Oh! by Aphrodité! how happy Athens will be!\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Why so?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. For a thousand reasons. None will dare now to do shameless\\ndeeds, to give false testimony or lay informations.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Stop! in the name of the gods! Do you want me to die of hunger?\\n\\nCHORUS. Good sir, let your wife speak.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. There will be no more thieves, nor envious people, no more\\nrags nor misery, no more abuse and no more prosecutions and lawsuits.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. By Posidon! \\'tis grand, if true.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. The results will prove it; you will confess it, and even these\\ngood people (_pointing to the spectators_) will not be able to say a\\nword.\\n\\nCHORUS. You have served your friends, but now it behoves you to apply\\nyour ability and your care to the welfare of the people. Devote the\\nfecundity of your mind to the public weal; adorn the citizens\\' lives with\\na thousand enjoyments and teach them to seize every favourable\\nopportunity. Devise some ingenious method to secure the much-needed\\nsalvation of Athens; but let neither your acts nor your words recall\\nanything of the past, for \\'tis only innovations that please. Don\\'t delay\\nthe realization of your plans, for speedy execution is greatly esteemed\\nby the public.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. I believe my ideas are good, but what I fear is, that the\\npublic will cling to the old customs and refuse to accept my reforms.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Have no fear about that. Love of novelty and disdain for the\\npast, these are the dominating principles among us.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Let none contradict nor interrupt me until I have explained my\\nplan. I want all to have a share of everything and all property to be in\\ncommon; there will no longer be either rich or poor; no longer shall we\\nsee one man harvesting vast tracts of land, while another has not ground\\nenough to be buried in, nor one man surround himself with a whole army of\\nslaves, while another has not a single attendant; I intend that there\\nshall only be one and the same condition of life for all.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. But how do you mean for all?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Go and eat your excrements![696]\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Come, share and share alike!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. No, no, but you shall not interrupt me. This is what I was\\ngoing to say: I shall begin by making land, money, everything that is\\nprivate property, common to all. Then we shall live on this common\\nwealth, which we shall take care to administer with wise thrift.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And how about the man who has no land, but only gold and silver\\ncoins, that cannot be seen?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. He must bring them to the common stock, and if he fails he\\nwill be a perjured man.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. That won\\'t worry him much, for has he not gained them by\\nperjury?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. But his riches will no longer be of any use to him.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Why?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. The poor will no longer be obliged to work; each will have all\\nthat he needs, bread, salt fish, cakes, tunics, wine, chaplets and\\nchick-pease; of what advantage will it be to him not to contribute his\\nshare to the common wealth? What do you think of it?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. But is it not the folk who rob most that have all these things?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Yes, formerly, under the old order of things; but now that all\\ngoods are in common, what will he gain by not bringing his wealth into\\nthe general stock?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. If someone saw a pretty wench and wished to satisfy his fancy\\nfor her, he would take some of his reserve store to make her a present\\nand stay the night with her; this would not prevent him claiming his\\nshare of the common property.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. But he can sleep with her for nothing; I intend that women\\nshall belong to all men in common, and each shall beget children by any\\nman that wishes to have her.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. But all will go to the prettiest woman and beseech her to go\\nwith him.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. The ugliest and the most flat-nosed will be side by side with\\nthe most charming, and to win the latter\\'s favours, a man will first have\\nto get into the former.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. But we old men, shall we have penis enough if we have to\\nsatisfy the ugly first?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. They will make no resistance.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. To what?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Never fear; they will make no resistance.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Resistance to what?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. To the pleasure of the thing. \\'Tis thus that matters will be\\nordered for you.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. \\'Tis right well conceived for you women, for every wench\\'s hole\\nwill be occupied; but as regards us poor men, you will leave those who\\nare ugly to run after the handsome fellows.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. The ugly will follow the handsomest into the public places\\nafter supper and see to it that the law, which forbids the women to sleep\\nwith the big, handsome men before having satisfied the ugly shrimps, is\\ncomplied with.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Thus ugly Lysicrates\\' nose will be as proud as the handsomest\\nface?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Yes, by Apollo! this is a truly popular decree, and what a\\nset-back \\'twill be for one of those elegants with their fingers loaded\\nwith rings, when a man with heavy shoes says to him, \"Give way to me and\\nwait till I have done; you will pass in after me.\"\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. But if we live in this fashion, how will each one know his\\nchildren?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. The youngest will look upon the oldest as their fathers.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Ah! how heartily they will strangle all the old men, since even\\nnow, when each one knows his father, they make no bones about strangling\\nhim! then, my word! won\\'t they just scorn and shit upon the old folks!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. But those around will prevent it. Hitherto, when anyone saw an\\nold man beaten, he would not meddle, because it did not concern him; but\\nnow each will fear the sufferer may be his own father and such violence\\nwill be stopped.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. What you say is not so silly after all; but \\'twould be highly\\nunpleasant were Epicurus and Leucolophas to come up and call me father.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. But \\'twould be far worse, were ...\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Were what?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. ... Aristyllus to embrace you and style you his father.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Ah! let him look to himself if he dares!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. For you would smell vilely of mint if he kissed you. But he\\nwas born before the decree was carried, so that you have not to fear his\\nkiss.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. \\'Twould be awful. But who will do the work?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. The slaves. Your only cares will be to scent yourself, and to\\ngo and dine, when the shadow of the gnomon is ten feet long on the dial.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. But how shall we obtain clothing? Tell me that!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. You will first wear out those you have, and then we women will\\nweave you others.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Now another point: if the magistrates condemn a citizen to the\\npayment of a fine, how is he going to do it? Out of the public funds?\\nThat would not be right surely.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. But there will be no more lawsuits.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. What a disaster for many people!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. I have decreed it. Besides, friend, why should there be\\nlawsuits?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Oh! for a thousand reasons, on my faith! Firstly, because a\\ndebtor denies his obligation.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. But where will the lender get the money to lend, if all is in\\ncommon? unless he steals it out of the treasury?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. That\\'s true, by Demeter! But then again, tell me this; here are\\nsome men who are returning from a feast and are drunk and they strike\\nsome passer-by; how are they going to pay the fine? Ah! you are puzzled\\nnow!\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. They will have to take it out of their pittance; and being\\nthus punished through their belly, they will not care to begin again.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. There will be no more thieves then, eh?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Why steal, if you have a share of everything?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. People will not be robbed any more at night?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. No, whether you sleep at home or in the street, there will be\\nno more danger, for all will have the means of living. Besides, if anyone\\nwanted to steal your cloak, you would give it him yourself. Why not? You\\nwill only have to go to the common store and be given a better one.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. There will be no more playing at dice?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. What object will there be in playing?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. But what kind of life is it you propose to set up?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. The life in common. Athens will become nothing more than a\\nsingle house, in which everything will belong to everyone; so that\\neverybody will be able to go from one house to the other at pleasure.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And where will the meals be served?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. The law-courts and the porticoes will be turned into\\ndining-halls.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And what will the speaker\\'s platform be used for?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. I shall place the bowls and the ewers there; and young\\nchildren will sing the glory of the brave from there, also the infamy of\\ncowards, who out of very shame will no longer dare to come to the public\\nmeals.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Well thought of, by Apollo! And what will you do with the urns?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. I shall have them taken to the market-place, and standing\\nclose to the statue of Harmodius,[697] I shall draw a lot for each\\ncitizen, which by its letter will show the place where he must go to\\ndine.[698] Thus, those for whom I have drawn a Beta, will go to the royal\\nportico;[699] if \\'tis a Theta, they will go to the portico of\\nTheseus;[700] if \\'tis a Kappa, to that of the flour-market.[701]\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. To cram[702] himself there like a capon?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. No, to dine there.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And the citizen whom the lot has not given a letter showing\\nwhere he is to dine will be driven off by everyone?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. But that will not occur. Each man will have plenty; he will\\nnot leave the feast until he is well drunk, and then with a chaplet on\\nhis head and a torch in his hand; and then the women running to meet you\\nin the cross-roads will say, \"This way, come to our house, you will find\\na beautiful young girl there.\"--\"And I,\" another will call from her\\nbalcony, \"have one so pretty and as white as milk; but before touching\\nher, you must sleep with me.\" And the ugly men, watching closely after\\nthe handsome fellows, will say, \"Hi! friend, where are you running to? Go\\nin, but you must do nothing, for \\'tis the ugly and the flat-nosed to whom\\nthe law gives the first right of admission; amuse yourself in the porch\\nwhile you wait, in handling your fig-leaves and playing with your tool.\"\\nWell, tell me, does that picture suit you?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Marvellously well.\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. I must now go to the market-place to receive the property that\\nis going to be placed in common and to choose a woman with a loud voice\\nas my herald. I have all the cares of State on my shoulders, since the\\npower has been entrusted to me. I must likewise go to busy myself about\\nestablishing the common meals, and you will attend your first banquet\\nto-day.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Are we going to banquet?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. Why, undoubtedly! Furthermore, I propose abolishing the\\ncourtesans.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. And what for?\\n\\nPRAXAGORA. \\'Tis clear enough why; so that, instead of them, _we_ may have\\nthe first-fruits of the young men. It is not meet that tricked-out slaves\\nshould rob free-born women of their pleasures. Let the courtesans be free\\nto sleep with the slaves and to depilate their privates for them.\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. I will march at your side, so that I may be seen and that\\neveryone may say, \"Admire our leader\\'s husband!\" [_Exeunt Blepyrus and\\nPraxagora._\\n\\n    [_The Chorus which followed this scene is lost._]\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Come, let us collect and examine all my belongings before\\ntaking them to the market-place. Come hither, my beautiful sieve, I have\\nnothing more precious than you, come, all clotted with the flour of which\\nI have poured so many sacks through you; you shall act the part of\\nCanephoros[703] in the procession of my chattels. Where is the sunshade\\ncarrier?[704] Ah! this stew-pot shall take his place. Great gods, how\\nblack it is! it could not be more so if Lysicrates[705] had boiled the\\ndrugs in it with which he dyes his hair. Hither, my beautiful mirror. And\\nyou, my tripod, bear this urn for me; you shall be the waterbearer;[706]\\nand you, cock, whose morning song has so often roused me in the middle of\\nthe night to send me hurrying to the Assembly, you shall be my\\nflute-girl. Scaphephoros,[707] do you take the large basin, place in it\\nthe honeycombs and twine the olive-branches over them, bring the tripods\\nand the phial of perfume; as for the humble crowd of little pots, I will\\njust leave them behind.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. What folly to carry one\\'s goods to the common store; I\\nhave a little more sense than that. No, no, by Posidon, I want first to\\nponder and calculate over the thing at leisure. I shall not be fool\\nenough to strip myself of the fruits of my toil and thrift, if it is not\\nfor a very good reason; let us see first, which way things turn. Hi!\\nfriend, what means this display of goods? Are you moving or are you going\\nto pawn your stuff?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Neither.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Why then are you setting all these things out in line? Is\\nit a procession that you are starting off to the public crier, Hiero?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. No, but in accordance with the new law, that has been\\ndecreed, I am going to carry all these things to the marketplace to make\\na gift of them to the State.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Oh! bah! you don\\'t mean that.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Certainly.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Oh! Zeus the Deliverer! you unfortunate man!\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Why?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Why? \\'Tis as clear as noonday.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Must the laws not be obeyed then?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. What laws, you poor fellow?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Those that have been decreed.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Decreed! Are you mad, I ask you?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Am I mad?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Oh! this is the height of folly!\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Because I obey the law? Is that not the first duty of an\\nhonest man?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Say rather of a ninny.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Don\\'t you propose taking what belongs to you to the common\\nstock?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. I\\'ll take good care I don\\'t until I see what the majority\\nare doing.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. There\\'s but one opinion, namely, to contribute every\\nsingle thing one has.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. I am waiting to see it, before I believe that.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. At least, so they say in every street.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. And they will go on saying so.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Everyone talks of contributing all he has.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. And will go on talking of it.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. You weary me with your doubts and dubitations.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Everybody else will doubt it.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. The pest seize you!\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. It _will_ take you. What? give up your goods! Is there a\\nman of sense who will do such a thing? Giving is not one of our customs.\\nReceiving is another matter; \\'tis the way of the gods themselves. Look at\\nthe position of their hands on their statues; when we ask a favour, they\\npresent their hands turned palm up so as not to give, but to receive.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Wretch, let me do what is right. Come, I\\'ll make a bundle\\nof all these things. Where is my strap?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Are you really going to carry them in?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Undoubtedly, and there are my three tripods strung\\ntogether already.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. What folly! Not to wait to see what the others do, and\\nthen ...\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Well, and then what?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. ... wait and put it off again.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. What for?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. That an earthquake may come or an ill-omened flash of\\nlightning, that a weasel may run across the street and that none carry in\\nanything more, you fool!\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. \\'Twould be a fine matter, were I to find no room left for\\nplacing all this.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. You are much more likely to lose your stuff. As for\\nplacing it, you can be at ease, for there will be room enough as long as\\na month hence.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Why?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. I know these folk; a decree is soon passed, but it is not\\nso easily attended to.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. All will contribute their property, my friend.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. But what if they don\\'t?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. But there is no doubt that they will.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. But _anyhow_, what if they don\\'t?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. We shall compel them to do so.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. And what if they prove the stronger?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. I shall leave my goods and go off.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. And what if they sell them for you?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. The plague take you!\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. And if it does?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. \\'Twill be a good riddance.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. You are bent on contributing then?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. \\'Pon my soul, yes! Look, there are all my neighbours\\ncarrying in all they have.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Ha, ha! \\'Tis no doubt Antisthenes.[708] He\\'s a fellow who\\nwould rather sit on his pot for thirty days than not!\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. The pest seize you!\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. And perhaps Callimachus[709] is going to take in more\\nmoney than Callias owns? That man want to ruin himself!\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. How you weary me!\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Ah! I weary you! But, wretch, see what comes of decrees\\nof this kind. Don\\'t you remember the one reducing the price of salt, eh?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Why, certainly I do.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. And do you remember that about the copper coinage?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Ah! that cursed money did me enough harm. I had sold my\\ngrapes and had my mouth stuffed with pieces of copper;[710] indeed I was\\ngoing to the market to buy flour, and was in the act of holding out my\\nbag wide open, when the herald started shouting, \"Let none in future\\naccept pieces of copper; those of silver are alone current.\"\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. And quite lately, were we not all swearing that the\\nimpost of one-fortieth, which Euripides[711] had conceived, would bring\\nfive talents to the State, and everyone was vaunting Euripides to the\\nskies? But when the thing was looked at closely, it was seen that this\\nfine decree was mere moonshine and would produce nothing, and you would\\nhave willingly burnt this very same Euripides alive.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. The cases are quite different, my good fellow. We were the\\nrulers then, but now \\'tis the women.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Whom, by Posidon, I will never allow to piss on my nose.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. I don\\'t know what the devil you\\'re chattering about.\\nSlave, pick up that bundle.\\n\\nHERALD. Let all citizens come, let them hasten at our leader\\'s bidding!\\n\\'Tis the new law. The lot will teach each citizen where he is to dine;\\nthe tables are already laid and loaded with the most exquisite dishes;\\nthe couches are covered with the softest of cushions; the wine and water\\nis already being mixed in the ewers; the slaves are standing in a row and\\nwaiting to pour scent over the guests; the fish is being grilled, the\\nhares are on the spit and the cakes are being kneaded, chaplets are being\\nplaited and the fritters are frying; the youngest women are watching the\\npea-soup in the saucepans, and in the midst of them all stands\\nSmaeus,[712] dressed as a knight, washing the crockery. And Geres[713]\\nhas come, dressed in a grand tunic and finely shod; he is joking with\\nanother young fellow and has already divested himself of his heavy shoes\\nand his cloak.[714] The pantryman is waiting, so come and use your jaws.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Aye, I\\'ll go. Why should I delay, since the Republic\\ncommands me?\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. And where are you going to, since you have not deposited\\nyour belongings?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. To the feast.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. If the women have any wits, they will first insist on your\\ndepositing your goods.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. But I am going to deposit them.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. When?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. I am not the man to make delays.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. How do you mean?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. There will be many less eager than I.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. In the meantime you are going to dine.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. What else should I do? Every sensible man must give his\\nhelp to the State.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. But if admission is forbidden you?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. I shall duck my head and slip in.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. And if the women have you beaten?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. I shall summon them.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. And if they laugh you in the face?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. I shall stand near the door ...\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. And then?\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. ... and seize upon the dishes as they pass.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. Then go there, but after me. Sicon and Parmeno,[715] pick\\nup all the baggage.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Come, I will help you carry it.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN. No, no, I should be afraid of your pretending to the\\nleader that what I am depositing belonged to you.\\n\\nSECOND CITIZEN. Let me see! let me think of some good trick by which I\\ncan keep my goods and yet take my share of the common feast. Ha! that\\'s a\\ngood notion! Quick! I\\'ll go and dine, ha, ha! [_Exit laughing_.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. How is this? no men are coming? And yet it must be fully\\ntime! \\'Tis then for naught that I have painted myself with white lead,\\ndressed myself in my beautiful yellow robe, and that I am here,\\nfrolicking and humming between my teeth to attract some passer-by! Oh,\\nMuses, alight upon my lips, inspire me with some soft Ionian love-song!\\n\\nA YOUNG GIRL. You rotten old thing, you have placed yourself at the\\nwindow before me. You were expecting to strip my vines during my absence\\nand to trap some man in your snares with your songs. If you sing, I shall\\nfollow suit; all this singing will weary the spectators, but is\\nnevertheless very pleasant and very diverting.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Ha! here is an old man; take him and lead him away. As\\nfor you, you young flute-player, let us hear some airs that are worthy of\\nyou and me. Let him who wishes to taste pleasure come to my side. These\\nyoung things know nothing about it; \\'tis only the women of ripe age who\\nunderstand the art of love, and no one could know how to fondle the lover\\nwho possessed me so well as myself; the young girls are all flightiness.\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. Don\\'t be jealous of the young girls; voluptuousness resides\\nin the pure outline of their beautiful limbs and blossoms on their\\nrounded bosoms; but you, old woman, you who are tricked out and perfumed\\nas if for your own funeral, are an object of love only for grim Death\\nhimself.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. May your hole be stopped; may you be unable to find your\\ncouch when you want to be fucked. And on your couch, when your lips seek\\na lover, may you embrace only a viper!\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. Alas! alas! what is to become of me? There is no lover! I am\\nleft here alone; my mother has gone out and the rest care little for me.\\nOh! my dear nurse, I adjure you to call Orthagoras, and may heaven bless\\nyou.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Ah! poor child, desire is consuming you like an Ionian\\nwoman; I think you are no stranger to the wanton arts of the Lesbian\\nwomen, but you shall not rob me of my pleasures; you will not be able to\\nreduce or filch the time that first belongs to me, for your own gain.\\nSing as much as you please, peep out like a cat lying in wait, but none\\nshall pass through your door without first having been to see me.\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. If anyone enter your house, \\'twill be to carry out your\\ncorpse.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. That\\'s new to me.\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. What! you rotten wretch, can anything be new to an old hag\\nlike you?\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. My old age will not harm you.\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. Ah! shame on your painted cheeks!\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Why do you speak to me at all?\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. And why do you place yourself at the window?\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. I am singing to myself about my lover, Epigenes.\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. Can you have any other lover than that old fop Geres?\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Epigenes will show you that himself, for he is coming to\\nme. See, here he is.\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. He\\'s not thinking of you in the least, you old witch.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Aye, but he is, you little pest.\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. Let\\'s see what he will do. I will leave my window.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. And I likewise. You will see I am not far wrong.\\n\\nA YOUNG MAN. Ah! could I but sleep with the young girl without first\\nsatisfying the old flat-nose! \\'Tis intolerable for a free-born man.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Willy nilly, you must first gratify my desire. There\\nshall be no nonsense about that, for my authority is the law and the law\\nmust be obeyed in a democracy. But come, let me hide, to see what he\\'s\\ngoing to do.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Ah! ye gods, if I were to find the sweet child alone! for the\\nwine has fired my lust.\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. I have tricked that cursed old wretch; she has left her\\nwindow, thinking I would stay at home.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Ah! here is the lover we were talking of. This way, my\\nlove, this way, come here and haste to rest the whole night in my arms. I\\nworship your lovely curly hair; I am consumed with ardent desire. Oh!\\nEros, in thy mercy, compel him to my bed.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN (_standing beneath the young girl\\'s window and singing_).[716]\\nCome down and haste to open the door unless you want to see me fall dead\\nwith desire. Dearest treasure, I am burning to yield myself to most\\nvoluptuous sport, lying on your bosom, to let my hands play with your\\nbuttocks. Aphrodité, why dost thou fire me with such delight in her? Oh!\\nEros, I beseech thee, have mercy and make her share my couch. Words\\ncannot express the tortures I am suffering. Oh! my adored one, I adjure\\nyou, open your door for me and press me to your heart; \\'tis for you that\\nI am suffering. Oh! my jewel, my idol, you child of Aphrodité, the\\nconfidante of the Muses, the sister of the Graces, you living picture of\\nVoluptuousness, oh! open for me, press me to your heart, \\'tis for you\\nthat I am suffering.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Are you knocking? Is it I you seek?\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. What an idea!\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. But you were tapping at the door.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Death would be sweeter.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Why do you come with that torch in your hand?\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. I am looking for a man from Anaphlystia.[717]\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. What\\'s his name?\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Oh! \\'tis not Sebinus,[718] whom no doubt you are expecting.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. By Aphrodité, you _must_, whether you like it or not.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. We are not now concerned with cases dated sixty years back;\\nthey are remanded for a later day; we are dealing only with those of less\\nthan twenty.[719]\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. That was under the old order of things, sweetheart, but\\nnow you must first busy yourself with us.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Aye, _if I want to_, according to the rules of draughts, where\\nwe may either take or leave.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. But \\'tis not according to the rules of draughts that you\\ntake your seat at the banquet.[720]\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. I don\\'t know what you mean; \\'tis at this door I want to knock.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Not before knocking at mine first.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. For the moment I really have no need for old leather.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. I know that you love me; perhaps you are surprised to\\nfind me at the door. But come, let me kiss you.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. No, no, my dear, I am afraid of your lover.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Of whom?\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. The most gifted of painters.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Why, whom do you mean to speak of?\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. The artist who paints the little bottles on coffins.[721] But\\nget you indoors, lest he should find you at the door.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. I know what you want.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. I can say as much of you.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. By Aphrodité, who has granted me this good chance, I\\nwon\\'t let you go.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. You are drivelling, you little old hag.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Rubbish! I am going to lead you to my couch.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. What need for buying hooks? I will let her down to the bottom\\nof the well and pull up the buckets with her old carcase, for she\\'s\\ncrooked enough for that.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. A truce to your jeering, poor boy, and follow me.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Nothing compels me to do so, unless you have paid the levy of\\nfive hundredths for me.[722]\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Look, by Aphrodité, there is nothing that delights me as\\nmuch as sleeping with a lad of your years.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. And I abhor such as you, and I will never, never consent.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. But, by Zeus, here is something will force you to it.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. What\\'s that?\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. A decree, which orders you to enter my house.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Read it out then, and let\\'s hear.\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Listen. \"The women have decreed, that if a young man\\ndesires a young girl, he can only possess her after having satisfied an\\nold woman; and if he refuses and goes to seek the maiden, the old women\\nare authorized to seize him by his privates and so drag him in.\"\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Alas! I shall become a Procrustes.[723]\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Obey the law.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. But if a fellow-citizen, a friend, came to pay my ransom?\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. No man may dispose of anything above a medimnus.[724]\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. But may I not enter an excuse?\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. There\\'s no evasion.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. I shall declare myself a merchant and so escape service.[725]\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Beware what you do!\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Well! what is to be done?\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Follow me.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Is it absolutely necessary?\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Yes, as surely as if Diomedes had commanded it.[726]\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Well then, first spread out a layer of origanum[727] upon four\\npieces of wood; bind fillets round your head, bring phials of scent and\\nplace a bowl filled with lustral water before your door.[728]\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Will you buy a chaplet for me too?\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Aye, if you outlast the tapers; for I expect to see you fall\\ndown dead as you go in.\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. Where are you dragging this unfortunate man to?\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. \\'Tis my very own property that I am leading in.\\n\\nYOUNG GIRL. You do ill. A young fellow like him is not of the age to suit\\nyou. You ought to be his mother rather than his wife. With these laws in\\nforce, the earth will be filled with Oedipuses.[729]\\n\\nFIRST OLD WOMAN. Oh! you cursed pest! \\'tis envy that makes you say this;\\nbut I will be revenged.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. By Zeus the Deliverer, what a service you have done me, by\\nfreeing me of this old wretch! with what ardour I will show you my\\ngratitude in a form both long and thick!\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. Hi! you there! where are you taking that young man to,\\nin spite of the law? The decree ordains that he must first sleep with me.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Oh! what a misfortune! Where does _this_ hag come from? \\'Tis a\\nmore frightful monster than the other even.\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. Come here.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN (_to the young girl_). Oh! I adjure you, don\\'t let me be led\\noff by her!\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. \\'Tis not I; \\'tis the law that leads you off.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. No, \\'tis not the law, but an Empusa[730] with a body covered\\nwith blemishes and blotches.\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. Follow me, my handsome little friend, come along quick\\nwithout any more ado.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Oh! let me first do the needful, so that I may gather my wits\\nsomewhat. Else I should be so terrified that you would see me letting out\\nsomething yellow.\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. Never mind! you can stool, if you want, in my house.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Oh! I fear doing more than I want to; but I offer you two good\\nsecurities.\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. I don\\'t require them.\\n\\nTHIRD OLD WOMAN. Hi! friend, where are you off to with that woman?\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. I am not going with her, but am being dragged by force. Oh!\\nwhoever you are, may heaven bless you for having had pity on me in my\\ndire misfortune. (_Turns round and sees the Third Old Woman._) Oh\\nHeracles! oh Heracles! oh Pan! Oh ye Corybantes! oh ye Dioscuri! Why, she\\nis still more awful! Oh! what a monster! great gods! Are you an ape\\nplastered with white lead, or the ghost of some old hag returned from the\\ndark borderlands of death?\\n\\nTHIRD OLD WOMAN. No jesting! Follow me.\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. No, come this way.\\n\\nTHIRD OLD WOMAN. I will never let you go.\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. Nor will I.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. But you will rend me asunder, you cursed wretches.\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. \\'Tis I he must go with according to the law.\\n\\nTHIRD OLD WOMAN. Not if an uglier old woman than yourself appears.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. But if you kill me at the outset, how shall I afterwards go to\\nfind this beautiful girl of mine?\\n\\nTHIRD OLD WOMAN. That\\'s your business. But begin by obeying.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Of which one must I rid myself first?\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. Don\\'t you know? Come here.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Then let the other one release me.\\n\\nTHIRD OLD WOMAN. Come to my house.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. If this dame will let me go.\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. No, by all the gods, I\\'ll not let you go.\\n\\nTHIRD OLD WOMAN. Nor will I.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. You would make very bad boatwomen.\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. Why?\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Because you would tear your passengers to pieces in dragging\\nthem on board.\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. Then come along, do, and hold your tongue.\\n\\nTHIRD OLD WOMAN. No, by Zeus, come with me.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. \\'Tis clearly a case of the decree of Cannonus;[731] I must cut\\nmyself in two in order to fuck you both. But how am I to work two oars at\\nonce?\\n\\nSECOND OLD WOMAN. Easily enough; you have only to eat a full pot of\\nonions.[732]\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Oh! great gods! here I am close to the door and being dragged\\nin!\\n\\nTHIRD OLD WOMAN (_to Second Old Woman_). You will gain nothing by this,\\nfor I shall rush into your house with you.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. Oh, no! no! \\'twould be better to suffer a single misfortune\\nthan two.\\n\\nTHIRD OLD WOMAN. Ah! by Hecaté, \\'twill be all the same whether you wish\\nit or not.\\n\\nYOUNG MAN. What a fate is mine, that I must gratify such a stinking\\nharridan the whole night through and all day; then, when I am rid of her,\\nI have still to tackle a hag of brick-colour hue! Am I not truly\\nunfortunate? Ah! by Zeus the Deliverer! under what fatal star must I have\\nbeen born, that I must sail in company with such monsters! But if my bark\\nsinks in the sewer of these strumpets, may I be buried at the very\\nthreshold of the door; let this hag be stood upright on my grave, let her\\nbe coated alive with pitch and her legs covered with molten lead up to\\nthe ankles, and let her be set alight as a funeral lamp.\\n\\nA SERVANT-MAID TO PRAXAGORA (_she comes from the banquet_). What\\nhappiness is the people\\'s! what joy is mine, and above all that of my\\nmistress! Happy are ye, who form choruses before our house! Happy all ye,\\nboth neighbours and fellow-citizens! Happy am I myself! I am but a\\nservant, and yet I have poured on my hair the most exquisite essences.\\nLet thanks be rendered to thee, oh, Zeus! But a still more delicious\\naroma is that of the wine of Thasos; its sweet bouquet delights the\\ndrinker for a long enough, whereas the others lose their bloom and vanish\\nquickly. Therefore, long life to the wine-jars of Thasos! Pour yourselves\\nout unmixed wine, it will cheer you the whole night through, if you\\nchoose the liquor that possesses most fragrance. But tell me, friends,\\nwhere is my mistress\\'s husband?\\n\\nCHORUS. Wait for him here; he will no doubt pass this way.\\n\\nMAID-SERVANT. Ah! there he is just going to dinner. Oh! master! what joy!\\nwhat blessedness is yours!\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. Ah! d\\'you think so?\\n\\nMAID-SERVANT. None can compare his happiness to yours; you have reached\\nits utmost height, you who, alone out of thirty thousand citizens, have\\nnot yet dined.\\n\\nCHORUS Aye, here is undoubtedly a truly happy man.\\n\\nMAID-SERVANT. Where are you off to?\\n\\nBLEPYRUS. I am going to dine.\\n\\nMAID-SERVANT. By Aphrodité, you will be the last of all, far and away the\\nlast. Yet my mistress has bidden me take you and take with you these\\nyoung girls. Some Chian wine is left and lots of other good things.\\nTherefore hurry, and invite likewise all the spectators whom we have\\npleased, and such of the judges as are not against us, to follow us; we\\nwill offer them everything they can desire. Let our hospitality be large\\nand generous; forget no one, neither old nor young men, nor children.\\nDinner is ready for them all; they have but to go ... home.[733]\\n\\nCHORUS. I am betaking myself to the banquet with this torch in my hand\\naccording to custom. But why do you tarry, Blepyrus? Take these young\\ngirls with you and, while you are away a while, I will whet my appetite\\nwith some dining-song. I have but a few words to say: let the wise judge\\nme because of whatever is wise in this piece, and those who like a laugh\\nby whatever has made them laugh. In this way I address pretty well\\neveryone. If the lot has assigned my comedy to be played first of all,\\ndon\\'t let that be a disadvantage to me; engrave in your memory all that\\nshall have pleased you in it and judge the competitors equitably as you\\nhave bound yourselves by oath to do. Don\\'t act like vile courtesans, who\\nnever remember any but their last lover. It is time, friends, high time\\nto go to the banquet, if we want to have our share of it. Open your ranks\\nand let the Cretan rhythms regulate your dances.[734]\\n\\nSEMI-CHORUS. Ready; we are ready!\\n\\nCHORUS. And you others, let your light steps too keep time. Very soon\\nwill be served a very fine menu[*]--oysters-saltfish-skate-sharks\\'-heads\\nleft-over-vinegar-dressing-laserpitium-leek-with-honey-sauce-thrush\\nblackbird-pigeon-dove-roast-cock\\'s-brains-wagtail-cushat-hare-stewed\\nin-new-wine-gristle-of-veal-pullet\\'s-wings.[735] Come, quick, seize\\nhold of a plate, snatch up a cup, and let\\'s run to secure a place at\\ntable.

What an unhappy fate, great gods, to be the slave of a fool! A\\nservant may give the best of advice, but if his master does not follow\\nit, the poor slave must inevitably have his share in the disaster; for\\nfortune does not allow him to dispose of his own body, it belongs to his\\nmaster who has bought it. Alas! \\'tis the way of the world. But the god,\\nApollo, whose oracles the Pythian priestess on her golden tripod makes\\nknown to us, deserves my censure, for \\'tis assured he is a physician and\\na cunning diviner; and yet my master is leaving his temple infected with\\nmere madness and insists on following a blind man. Is this not opposed to\\nall good sense? \\'Tis for us, who see clearly, to guide those who don\\'t;\\nwhereas he clings to the trail of a blind fellow and compels me to do the\\nsame without answering my questions with ever a word. (_To Chremylus._)\\nAye, master, unless you tell me why we are following this unknown fellow,\\nI will not be silent, but I will worry and torment you, for you cannot\\nbeat me because of my sacred chaplet of laurel.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. No, but if you worry me I will take off your chaplet, and then\\nyou will only get a sounder thrashing.\\n\\nCARIO. That\\'s an old song! I am going to leave you no peace till you have\\ntold me who this man is; and if I ask it, \\'tis entirely because of my\\ninterest in you.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Well, be it so. I will reveal it to you as being the most\\nfaithful and the most rascally of all my servants.[736] I honoured the\\ngods and did what was right, and yet I was none the less poor and\\nunfortunate.\\n\\nCARIO. I know it but too well.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Other amassed wealth--the sacrilegious, the demagogues, the\\ninformers,[737] indeed every sort of rascal.\\n\\nCARIO. I believe you.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Therefore I came to consult the oracle of the god, not on my\\nown account, for my unfortunate life is nearing its end, but for my only\\nson; I wanted to ask Apollo, if it was necessary for him to become a\\nthorough knave and renounce his virtuous principles, since that seemed to\\nme to be the only way to succeed in life.\\n\\nCARIO. And with what responding tones did the sacred tripod resound?[738]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You shall know. The god ordered me in plain terms to follow\\nthe first man I should meet upon leaving the temple and to persuade him\\nto accompany me home.\\n\\nCARIO. And who was the first one you met?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. This blind man.\\n\\nCARIO. And you are stupid enough not to understand the meaning of such an\\nanswer? Why, the god was advising you thereby, and that in the clearest\\npossible way, to bring up your son according to the fashion of your\\ncountry.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. What makes you think that?\\n\\nCARIO. Is it not evident to the blind, that nowadays to do nothing that\\nis right is the best way to get on?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. No, that is not the meaning of the oracle; there must be\\nanother, that is nobler. If this blind man would tell us who he is and\\nwhy and with what object he has led us here, we should no doubt\\nunderstand what our oracle really does mean.\\n\\nCARIO (_to Plutus_). Come, tell us at once who you are, or I give effect\\nto my threat. (_He menaces him_.) And quick too, be quick, I say.\\n\\nPLUTUS. I\\'ll thrash you.\\n\\nCARIO (_to Chremylus_). Ha! is it thus he tells us his name?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. \\'Tis to you and not to me that he replies thus; your mode of\\nquestioning him was ill-advised. (_To Plutus._) Come, friend, if you care\\nto oblige an honest man, answer me.\\n\\nPLUTUS. I\\'ll knock you down.\\n\\nCARIO. Ah! what a pleasant fellow and what a delightful prophecy the god\\nhas given you!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. By Demeter, you\\'ll have no reason to laugh presently.\\n\\nCARIO. If you don\\'t speak, you wretch, I will surely do you an ill turn.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Friends, take yourselves off and leave me.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. That we very certainly shan\\'t.\\n\\nCARIO. This, master, is the best thing to do. I\\'ll undertake to secure\\nhim the most frightful death; I will lead him to the verge of a precipice\\nand then leave him there, so that he\\'ll break his neck when he pitches\\nover.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Well then, I leave him to you, and do the thing quickly.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Oh, no! Have mercy!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Will you speak then?\\n\\nPLUTUS. But if you learn who I am, I know well that you will ill-use me\\nand will not let me go again.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. I call the gods to witness that you have naught to fear if you\\nwill only speak.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Well then, first unhand me.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. There! we set you free.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Listen then, since I must reveal what I had intended to keep a\\nsecret. I am Plutus.[739]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Oh! you wretched rascal! You Plutus all the while, and you\\nnever said so!\\n\\nCARIO. You, Plutus, and in this piteous guise!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Oh, Phoebus Apollo! oh, ye gods of heaven and hell! Oh, Zeus!\\nis it really and truly as you say?\\n\\nPLUTUS. Aye.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Plutus\\' very own self?\\n\\nPLUTUS. His own very self and none other.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But tell me, whence come you to be so squalid?\\n\\nPLUTUS. I have just left Patrocles\\' house, who has not had a bath since\\nhis birth.[740]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But your infirmity; how did that happen? Tell me.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Zeus inflicted it on me, because of his jealousy of mankind. When\\nI was young, I threatened him that I would only go to the just, the wise,\\nthe men of ordered life; to prevent my distinguishing these, he struck me\\nwith blindness! so much does he envy the good!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And yet, \\'tis only the upright and just who honour him.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Quite true.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Therefore, if ever you recovered your sight, you would shun\\nthe wicked?\\n\\nPLUTUS. Undoubtedly.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You would visit the good?\\n\\nPLUTUS. Assuredly. It is a very long time since I saw them.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. That\\'s not astonishing. I, who see clearly, don\\'t see a single\\none.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Now let me leave you, for I have told you everything.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. No, certainly not! we shall fasten ourselves on to you faster\\nthan ever.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Did I not tell you, you were going to plague me?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Oh! I adjure you, believe what I say and don\\'t leave me; for\\nyou will seek in vain for a more honest man than myself.\\n\\nCARIO. There is only one man more worthy; and that is I.\\n\\nPLUTUS. All talk like this, but as soon as they secure my favours and\\ngrow rich, their wickedness knows no bounds.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And yet all men are not wicked.\\n\\nPLUTUS. All. There\\'s no exception.\\n\\nCARIO. You shall pay for that opinion.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Listen to what happiness there is in store for you, if you but\\nstay with us. I have hope; aye, I have good hope with the god\\'s help to\\ndeliver you from that blindness, in fact to restore your sight.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Oh! do nothing of the kind, for I don\\'t wish to recover it.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. What\\'s that you say?\\n\\nCARIO. This fellow hugs his own misery.\\n\\nPLUTUS. If you were mad enough to cure me, and Zeus heard of it, he would\\noverwhelm me with his anger.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And is he not doing this now by leaving you to grope your\\nwandering way?\\n\\nPLUTUS. I don\\'t know; but I\\'m horribly afraid of him.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Indeed? Ah! you are the biggest poltroon of all the gods! Why,\\nZeus with his throne and his lightnings would not be worth an obolus if\\nyou recovered your sight, were it but for a few instants.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Impious man, don\\'t talk like that.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Fear nothing! I will prove to you that you are far more\\npowerful and mightier than he.\\n\\nPLUTUS. I mightier than he?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Aye, by heaven! For instance, what is the origin of the power\\nthat Zeus wields over the other gods?[741]\\n\\nCARIO. \\'Tis money; he has so much of it.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And who gives it to him?\\n\\nCARIO (_pointing to Plutus_). This fellow.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. If sacrifices are offered to him, is not Plutus their cause?\\n\\nCARIO. Undoubtedly, for \\'tis wealth that all demand and clamour most\\nloudly for.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Thus \\'tis Plutus who is the fount of all the honours rendered\\nto Zeus, whose worship he can wither up at the root, if it so please him.\\n\\nPLUTUS. And how so?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Not an ox, nor a cake, nor indeed anything at all could be\\noffered, if you did not wish it.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Why?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Why? but what means are there to buy anything if you are not\\nthere to give the money? Hence if Zeus should cause you any trouble, you\\nwill destroy his power without other help.\\n\\nPLUTUS. So \\'tis because of me that sacrifices are offered to him?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Most assuredly. Whatever is dazzling, beautiful or charming in\\nthe eyes of mankind, comes from you. Does not everything depend on\\nwealth?\\n\\nCARIO. I myself was bought for a few coins; if I\\'m a slave, \\'tis only\\nbecause I was not rich.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And what of the Corinthian courtesans?[742] If a poor man\\noffers them proposals, they do not listen; but if it be a rich one,\\ninstantly they offer their buttocks for his pleasure.\\n\\nCARIO. \\'Tis the same with the lads; they care not for love, to them money\\nmeans everything.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You speak of those who accept all comers; yet some of them are\\nhonest, and \\'tis not money they ask of their patrons.\\n\\nCARIO. What then?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. A fine horse, a pack of hounds.\\n\\nCARIO. Aye, they would blush to ask for money and cleverly disguise their\\nshame.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. \\'Tis in you that every art, all human inventions, have had\\ntheir origin; \\'tis through you that one man sits cutting leather in his\\nshop.\\n\\nCARIO. That another fashions iron or wood.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. That yet another chases the gold he has received from you.\\n\\nCARIO. That one is a fuller.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. That t\\'other washes wool.\\n\\nCARIO. That this one is a tanner.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And that other sells onions.\\n\\nCARIO. And if the adulterer, caught red-handed, is depilated,[743] \\'tis\\non account of you.[744]\\n\\nPLUTUS. Oh! great gods! I knew naught of all this!\\n\\nCARIO. Is it not he who lends the Great King all his pride?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Is it not he who draws the citizens to the Assembly?[745]\\n\\nCARIO. And tell me, is it not you who equip the triremes?[746]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And who feed our mercenaries at Corinth?[747]\\n\\nCARIO. Are not you the cause of Pamphilus\\' sufferings?[748]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And of the needle-seller\\'s[749] with Pamphilus?\\n\\nCARIO. Is it not because of you that Agyrrhius[750] lets wind so loudly?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And that Philepsius[751] rolls off his fables?\\n\\nCARIO. That troops are sent to succour the Egyptians?[752]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And that Laïs is kept by Philonides?[753]\\n\\nCARIO. That the tower of Timotheus[754] ...\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. ... (_To Cario._) May it fall upon your head! (_To Plutus._)\\nIn short, Plutus, \\'tis through you that everything is done; be it known\\nto you that you are the sole cause both of good and evil.\\n\\nCARIO. In war, \\'tis the flag under which you serve that victory favours.\\n\\nPLUTUS. What! I can do so many things by myself and unaided?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And many others besides; wherefore men are never tired of your\\ngifts. They get weary of all else,--of love ...\\n\\nCARIO. Of bread.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Of music.\\n\\nCARIO. Of sweetmeats.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Of honours.\\n\\nCARIO. Of cakes.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Of battles.\\n\\nCARIO. Of figs.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Of ambition.\\n\\nCARIO. Of gruel.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Of military advancement.\\n\\nCARIO. Of lentils.[755]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But of you they never tire. Has a man got thirteen talents, he\\nhas all the greater ardour to possess sixteen; is that wish achieved, he\\nwill want forty or will complain that he knows not how to make the two\\nends meet.\\n\\nPLUTUS. All this, methinks, is very true; there is but one point that\\nmakes me feel a bit uneasy.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And that is?\\n\\nPLUTUS. How could I use this power, which you say I have?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Ah! they were quite right who said, there\\'s nothing more\\ntimorous than Plutus.\\n\\nPLUTUS. No, no; it was a thief who calumniated me. Having broken into a\\nhouse, he found everything locked up and could take nothing, so he dubbed\\nmy prudence fear.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Don\\'t be disturbed; if you support me zealously, I\\'ll make you\\nmore sharp-sighted than Lynceus.[756]\\n\\nPLUTUS. And how should you be able to do that, you, who are but a mortal?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. I have great hope, after the answer Apollo gave me, shaking\\nhis sacred laurels the while.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Is _he_ in the plot then?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Aye, truly.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Take care what you say.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Never fear, friend; for, be well assured, that if it has to\\ncost me my life, I will carry out what I have in my head.\\n\\nCARIO. And I will help you, if you permit it.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. We shall have many other helpers as well--all the worthy folk\\nwho are wanting for bread.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Ah! ha! they\\'ll prove sorry helpers.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. No, not so, once they\\'ve grown rich. But you, Cario, run quick\\n...\\n\\nCARIO. Where?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. ... to call my comrades, the other husbandmen, that each of\\nthem may come here to take his share of the gifts of Plutus.\\n\\nCARIO. I\\'m off. But let someone come from the house to take this morsel\\nof meat.[757]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. I\\'ll see to that; you run your hardest. As for you, Plutus,\\nthe most excellent of all the gods, come in here with me; this is the\\nhouse you must fill with riches today, by fair means or foul.[758]\\n\\nPLUTUS. I don\\'t like at all going into other folks\\' houses in this\\nmanner; I have never got any good from it. If I got inside a miser\\'s\\nhouse, straightway he would bury me deep underground; if some honest\\nfellow among his friends came to ask him for the smallest coin, he would\\ndeny ever having seen me. Then if I went to a fool\\'s house, he would\\nsacrifice me as a prey to gaming and to girls, and very soon I should be\\ncompletely stripped and pitched out of doors.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. That\\'s because you have never met a man who knew how to avoid\\nthe two extremes; moderation is the strong point in my character. I love\\nsaving as much as anybody, and I know how to spend, when \\'tis needed. But\\nlet us go in; I want to make you known to my wife and to my only son,\\nwhom I love most of all after yourself.\\n\\nPLUTUS. Aye, after myself, I\\'m very sure of that.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Why should I hide the truth from you?\\n\\nCARIO. Come, you active workers, who, like my master, eat nothing but\\ngarlic and the poorest food, you who are his friends and his neighbours,\\nhasten your steps, hurry yourselves; there\\'s not a moment to lose; this\\nis the critical hour, when your presence and your support is needed by\\nhim.\\n\\nCHORUS. Why, don\\'t you see we are speeding as fast as men can, who are\\nalready enfeebled by age? But do you deem it fitting to make us run like\\nthis before ever telling us why your master has called us?\\n\\nCARIO. I\\'ve grown hoarse with the telling, but you won\\'t listen. My\\nmaster is going to drag you all out of the stupid, sapless life you are\\nleading and ensure you one full of all delights.\\n\\nCHORUS. And how is he going to manage that?\\n\\nCARIO. My poor friends, he has brought with him a disgusting old fellow,\\nall bent and wrinkled, with a most pitiful appearance, bald and\\ntoothless; upon my word, I even believe he is circumcised like some vile\\nbarbarian.\\n\\nCHORUS. These are news worth their weight in gold! What are you saying?\\nRepeat it to me; no doubt it means he is bringing back a heap of wealth.\\n\\nCARIO. No, but a heap of all the infirmities attendant on old age.\\n\\nCHORUS. If you are tricking us, you shall pay us for it. Beware of our\\nsticks!\\n\\nCARIO. Do you deem me so brazen as all that, and my words mere lies?\\n\\nCHORUS. What serious airs the rascal puts on! Look! his legs are already\\nshrieking, \"oh! oh!\" they are asking for the shackles and wedges.\\n\\nCARIO. \\'Tis in the tomb that \\'tis your lot to judge. Why don\\'t you go\\nthere? Charon has given you your ticket.[759]\\n\\nCHORUS. Plague take you! you cursed rascal, who rail at us and have not\\neven the heart to tell us why your master has made us come. We were\\npressed for time and tired out, yet we came with all haste, and in our\\nhurry we have passed by lots of wild onions without even gathering them.\\n\\nCARIO. I will no longer conceal the truth from you. Friends, \\'tis Plutus\\nwhom my master brings, Plutus, who will give you riches.\\n\\nCHORUS. What! we shall really all become rich!\\n\\nCARIO. Aye, certainly; you will then be Midases, provided you grow ass\\'s\\nears.\\n\\nCHORUS. What joy, what happiness! If what you tell me is true, I long to\\ndance with delight.\\n\\nCARIO. And I too, threttanello![760] I want to imitate Cyclops and lead\\nyour troop by stamping like this.[761] Do you, my dear little ones, cry,\\naye, cry again and bleat forth the plaintive song of the sheep and of the\\nstinking goats; follow me with erected organs like lascivious goats ready\\nfor action.\\n\\nCHORUS. As for us, threttanello! we will seek you, dear Cyclops,\\nbleating, and if we find you with your wallet full of fresh herbs, all\\ndisgusting in your filth, sodden with wine and sleeping in the midst of\\nyour sheep, we will seize a great flaming stake and burn out your\\neye.[762]\\n\\nCARIO. I will copy that Circé of Corinth,[763] whose potent philtres\\ncompelled the companions of Philonides to swallow balls of dung, which\\nshe herself had kneaded with her hands, as if they were swine; and do you\\ntoo grunt with joy and follow your mother, my little pigs.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! Circé[764] with the potent philtres, who besmear your\\ncompanions so filthily, what pleasure I shall have in imitating the son\\nof Laertes! I will hang you up by your testicles,[765] I will rub your\\nnose with dung like a goat, and like Aristyllus[766] you shall say\\nthrough your half-opened lips, \"Follow your mother, my little pigs.\"\\n\\nCARIO. Enough of tomfoolery, assume a grave demeanour; unknown to my\\nmaster I am going to take bread and meat; and when I have fed well, I\\nshall resume my work.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. To say, \"Hail! my dear neighbours!\" is an old form of greeting\\nand well worn with use; so therefore I embrace you, because you have not\\ncrept like tortoises, but have come rushing here in all haste. Now help\\nme to watch carefully and closely over the god.\\n\\nCHORUS. Be at ease. You shall see with what martial zeal I will guard\\nhim. What! we jostle each other at the Assembly for three obols, and am I\\ngoing to let Plutus in person be stolen from me?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But I see Blepsidemus; by his bearing and his haste I can\\nreadily see he knows or suspects something.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. What has happened then? Whence, how has Chremylus suddenly\\ngrown rich? I don\\'t believe a word of it. Nevertheless, nothing but his\\nsudden fortune was being talked about in the barbers\\' booths. But I am\\nabove all surprised that his good fortune has not made him forget his\\nfriends; that is not the usual way!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. By the gods, Blepsidemus, I will hide nothing from you. To-day\\nthings are better than yesterday; let us share, for are you not my\\nfriend?\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Have you really grown rich as they say?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS I shall be soon, if the god agrees to it. But there is still\\nsome risk to run.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. What risk?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. What risk?\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. What do you mean? Explain.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. If we succeed, we are happy for ever, but if we fail, it is\\nall over with us.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. \\'Tis a bad business, and one that doesn\\'t please me! To grow\\nrich all at once and yet to be fearful! ah! I suspect something that\\'s\\nlittle good.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. What do you mean, that\\'s little good?\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. No doubt you have just stolen some gold and silver from some\\ntemple and are repenting.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Nay! heaven preserve me from that!\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. A truce to idle phrases!  the thing is only too apparent, my\\nfriend.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Don\\'t suspect such a thing of me.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Alas! then there is no honest man! not one, that can resist\\nthe attraction of gold!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. By Demeter, you have no common sense.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. To have to persist like this in denial one\\'s whole life\\nlong!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But, good gods, you are mad, my dear fellow!\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. His very look is distraught; he has done some crime!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Ah! I know the tune you are playing now; you think I have\\nstolen, and want your share.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. My share of what, pray?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You are beside the mark; the thing is quite otherwise.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. \\'Tis perhaps not a theft, but some piece of knavery!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You are insane!\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. What? You have done no man an injury?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. No! assuredly not!\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. But, great gods, what am I to think? You won\\'t tell me the\\ntruth.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You accuse me without really knowing anything.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Listen, friend, no doubt the matter can yet be hushed up,\\nbefore it gets noised abroad, at trifling expense; I will buy the\\norators\\' silence.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Aye, you will lay out three minae and, as my friend, you will\\nreckon twelve against me.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. I know someone who will come and seat himself at the foot of\\nthe tribunal, holding a supplicant\\'s bough in his hand and surrounded by\\nhis wife and children, for all the world like the Heraclidae of\\nPamphilus.[767]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Not at all, poor fool! But, thanks to me, worthy folk,\\nintelligent and moderate men alone shall be rich henceforth.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. What are you saying? Have you then stolen so much as all\\nthat?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Oh! your insults will be the death of me.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. \\'Tis rather you yourself who are courting death.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Not so, you wretch, since I have Plutus.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. You have Plutus? Which one?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. The god himself.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. And where is he?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. There.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Where?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Indoors.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Indoors?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Aye, certainly.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Get you gone! Plutus in your house?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Yes, by the gods!\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Are you telling me the truth?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. I am.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Swear it by Hestia.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. I swear it by Posidon.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. The god of the sea?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Aye, and by all the other Posidons, if such there be.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. And you don\\'t send him to us, to your friends?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. We\\'ve not got to that point yet.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. What do you say? Is there no chance of sharing?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Why, no. We must first ...\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Do what?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. ... restore him his sight.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Restore whom his sight? Speak!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Plutus. It must be done, no matter how.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Is he then really blind?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Yes, undoubtedly.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. I am no longer surprised he never came to me.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And it please the gods, he\\'ll come there now.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Must we not go and seek a physician?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Seek physicians at Athens? Nay! there\\'s no art where there\\'s\\nno fee.[768]\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Let\\'s bethink ourselves well.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. There is not one.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. \\'Tis a positive fact, I don\\'t know of one.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But I have thought the matter well over, and the best thing is\\nto make Plutus lie in the Temple of Aesculapius.[769]\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Aye, unquestionably \\'tis the very best thing. Be quick and\\nlead him away to the Temple.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. I am going there.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Then hurry yourself.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. \\'Tis just what I am doing.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Unwise, perverse, unholy men! What are you daring to do, you\\npitiful, wretched mortals? Whither are you flying? Stop! I command it!\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Oh! great gods!\\n\\nPOVERTY. My arm shall destroy you, you infamous beings! Such an attempt\\nis not to be borne; neither man nor god has ever dared the like. You\\nshall die!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And who are you?  Oh! what a ghastly pallor!\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. \\'Tis perchance some Erinnys, some Fury, from the\\ntheatre;[770] there\\'s a kind of wild tragedy look in her eyes.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But she has no torch.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Let\\'s knock her down!\\n\\nPOVERTY. Who do you think I am?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Some wine-shop keeper or egg-woman. Otherwise you would not\\nhave shrieked so loud at us, who have done nothing to you.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Indeed? And have you not done me the most deadly injury by\\nseeking to banish me from every country?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Why, have you not got the Barathrum[771] left? But who are\\nyou? Answer me quickly!\\n\\nPOVERTY. I am one that will punish you this very day for having wanted to\\nmake me disappear from here.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Might it be the tavern-keeper in my neighbourhood, who is\\nalways cheating me in measure?\\n\\nPOVERTY. I am Poverty, who have lived with you for so many years.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Oh! great Apollo! oh, ye gods! whither shall I fly?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Now then! what are you doing? You poltroon! Will you kindly\\nstop here?\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Not I.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Will you have the goodness to stop. Are two men to fly from a\\nwoman?\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. But, you wretch, \\'tis Poverty, the most fearful monster that\\never drew breath.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Stay where you are, I beg of you.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. No! no! a thousand times, no!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Could we do anything worse than leave the god in the lurch and\\nfly before this woman without so much as ever offering to fight?\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. But what weapons have we? Are we in a condition to show\\nfight? Where is the breastplate, the buckler, that this wretch has not\\npledged?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Be at ease. Plutus will readily triumph over her threats\\nunaided.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Dare you reply, you scoundrels, you who are caught red-handed at\\nthe most horrible crime?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. As for you, you cursed jade, you pursue me with your abuse,\\nthough I have never done you the slightest harm.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Do you think it is doing me no harm to restore Plutus to the use\\nof his eyes?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Is this doing you harm, that we shower blessings on all men?\\n\\nPOVERTY. And what do you think will ensure their happiness?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Ah! first of all we shall drive you out of Greece.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Drive me out? Could you do mankind a greater harm?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Yes--if I gave up my intention to deliver them from you.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Well, let us discuss this point first. I propose to show that I\\nam the sole cause of all your blessings, and that your safety depends on\\nme alone. If I don\\'t succeed, then do what you like to me.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. How dare you talk like this, you impudent hussy?\\n\\nPOVERTY. Agree to hear me and I think it will be very easy for me to\\nprove that you are entirely on the wrong road, when you want to make the\\njust men wealthy.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Oh! cudgel and rope\\'s end, come to my help!\\n\\nPOVERTY. Why such wrath and these shouts, before you hear my arguments?\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. But who could listen to such words without exclaiming?\\n\\nPOVERTY. Any man of sense.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But if you lose your case, what punishment will you submit to?\\n\\nPOVERTY. Choose what you will.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. That\\'s all right.\\n\\nPOVERTY. You shall suffer the same if you are beaten!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Do you think twenty deaths a sufficiently large stake?\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Good enough for her, but for us two would suffice.\\n\\nPOVERTY. You won\\'t escape, for is there indeed a single valid argument to\\noppose me with?\\n\\nCHORUS. To beat her in this debate, you must call upon all your wits.\\nMake no allowances and show no weakness!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. It is right that the good should be happy, that the wicked and\\nthe impious, on the other hand, should be miserable; that is a truth, I\\nbelieve, which no one will gainsay. To realize this condition of things\\nis as great a proposal as it is noble and useful in every respect, and we\\nhave found a means of attaining the object of our wishes. If Plutus\\nrecovers his sight and ceases from wandering about unseeing and at\\nrandom, he will go to seek the just men and never leave them again; he\\nwill shun the perverse and ungodly; so, thanks to him, all men will\\nbecome honest, rich and pious. Can anything better be conceived for the\\npublic weal?\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Of a certainty, no! I bear witness to that. It is not even\\nnecessary she should reply.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Does it not seem that everything is extravagance in the world,\\nor rather madness, when you watch the way things go? A crowd of rogues\\nenjoy blessings they have won by sheer injustice, while more honest folks\\nare miserable, die of hunger, and spend their whole lives with you.\\n\\nCHORUS. Yes, if Plutus became clear-sighted again and drove out Poverty,\\n\\'twould be the greatest blessing possible for the human race.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Here are two old men, whose brains are easy to confuse, who\\nassist each other to talk rubbish and drivel to their hearts\\' content.\\nBut if your wishes were realized, your profit would be great! Let Plutus\\nrecover his sight and divide his favours out equally to all, and none\\nwill ply either trade or art any longer; all toil would be done away\\nwith. Who would wish to hammer iron, build ships, sew, turn, cut up\\nleather, bake bricks, bleach linen, tan hides, or break up the soil of\\nthe earth with the plough and garner the gifts of Demeter, if he could\\nlive in idleness and free from all this work?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. What nonsense all this is! All these trades which you just\\nmention will be plied by our slaves.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Your slaves! And by what means will these slaves be got?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. We will buy them.\\n\\nPOVERTY. But first say, who will sell them, if everyone is rich?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Some greedy dealer from Thessaly--the land which supplies so\\nmany.\\n\\nPOVERTY. But if your system is applied, there won\\'t be a single\\nslave-dealer left. What rich man would risk his life to devote himself to\\nthis traffic? You will have to toil, to dig and submit yourself to all\\nkinds of hard labour; so that your life would be more wretched even than\\nit is now.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. May this prediction fall upon yourself!\\n\\nPOVERTY. You will not be able to sleep in a bed, for no more will ever be\\nmanufactured; nor on carpets, for who would weave them if he had gold?\\nWhen you bring a young bride to your dwelling, you will have no essences\\nwherewith to perfume her, nor rich embroidered cloaks dyed with dazzling\\ncolours in which to clothe her. And yet what is the use of being rich, if\\nyou are to be deprived of all these enjoyments? On the other hand, you\\nhave all that you need in abundance, thanks to me; to the artisan I am\\nlike a severe mistress, who forces him by need and poverty to seek the\\nmeans of earning his livelihood.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And what good thing can you give us, unless it be burns in the\\nbath,[772] and swarms of brats and old women who cry with hunger, and\\nclouds uncountable of lice, gnats and flies, which hover about the\\nwretch\\'s head, trouble him, awake him and say, \"You will be hungry, but\\nget up!\" Besides, to possess a rag in place of a mantle, a pallet of\\nrushes swarming with bugs, that do not let you close your eyes for a bed;\\na rotten piece of matting for a coverlet; a big stone for a pillow, on\\nwhich to lay your head; to eat mallow roots instead of bread, and leaves\\nof withered radish instead of cake; to have nothing but the cover of a\\nbroken jug for a stool, the stave of a cask, and broken at that, for a\\nkneading-trough, that is the life you make for us! Are these the mighty\\nbenefits with which you pretend to load mankind?\\n\\nPOVERTY. \\'Tis not my life that you describe; you are attacking the\\nexistence beggars lead.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Is beggary not Poverty\\'s sister?\\n\\nPOVERTY. Thrasybulus and Dionysius[773] are one and the same according to\\nyou. No, my life is not like that and never will be. The beggar, whom you\\nhave depicted to us, never possesses anything. The poor man lives\\nthriftily and attentive to his work; he has not got too much, but he does\\nnot lack what he really needs.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Oh! what a happy life, by Demeter! to live sparingly, to toil\\nincessantly and not to leave enough to pay for a tomb!\\n\\nPOVERTY. That\\'s it! Jest, jeer, and never talk seriously! But what you\\ndon\\'t know is this, that men with me are worth more, both in mind and\\nbody, than with Plutus. With him they are gouty, big-bellied, heavy of\\nlimb and scandalously stout; with me they are thin, wasp-waisted, and\\nterrible to the foe.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. \\'Tis no doubt by starving them that you give them that waspish\\nwaist.\\n\\nPOVERTY. As for behaviour, I will prove to you that modesty dwells with\\nme and insolence with Plutus.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Oh! the sweet modesty of stealing and breaking through\\nwalls.[774]\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Aye, the thief is truly modest, for he hides himself.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Look at the orators in our republics; as long as they are poor,\\nboth State and people can only praise their uprightness; but once they\\nare fattened on the public funds, they conceive a hatred for justice,\\nplan intrigues against the people and attack the democracy.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. That is absolutely true, although your tongue is very vile.\\nBut it matters not, so don\\'t put on those triumphant airs; you shall not\\nbe punished any the less for having tried to persuade me that poverty is\\nworth more than wealth.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Not being able to refute my arguments, you chatter at random and\\nexert yourself to no purpose.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Then tell me this, why does all mankind flee from you?\\n\\nPOVERTY. Because I make them better. Children do the very same; they flee\\nfrom the wise counsels of their fathers. So difficult is it to see one\\'s\\ntrue interest.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Will you say that Zeus cannot discern what is best? Well, he\\ntakes Plutus to himself ...\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. ... and banishes Poverty to earth.\\n\\nPOVERTY. Ah me! how purblind you are, you old fellows of the days of\\nSaturn! Why, Zeus is poor, and I will clearly prove it to you. In the\\nOlympic games, which he founded, and to which he convokes the whole of\\nGreece every four years, why does he only crown the victorious athletes\\nwith wild olive? If he were rich he would give them gold.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. \\'Tis in that way he shows that he clings to his wealth; he is\\nsparing with it, won\\'t part with any portion of it, only bestows baubles\\non the victors and keeps his money for himself.\\n\\nPOVERTY. But wealth coupled to such sordid greed is yet more shameful\\nthan poverty.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. May Zeus destroy you, both you and your chaplet of wild olive!\\n\\nPOVERTY. Thus you dare to maintain that poverty is not the fount of all\\nblessings!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Ask Hecaté[775] whether it is better to be rich or starving;\\nshe will tell you that the rich send her a meal every month and that the\\npoor make it disappear before it is even served. But go and hang yourself\\nand don\\'t breathe another syllable. I will not be convinced against my\\nwill.\\n\\nPOVERTY. \"Oh! citizens of Argos! do you hear what he says?\"[776]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Invoke Pauson, your boon companion, rather.[777]\\n\\nPOVERTY. Alas! what is to become of me?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Get you gone, be off quick and a pleasant journey to you.\\n\\nPOVERTY. But where shall I go?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. To gaol; but hurry up, let us put an end to this.\\n\\nPOVERTY. One day you will recall me.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Then you can return; but disappear for the present. I prefer\\nto be rich; you are free to knock your head against the walls in your\\nrage.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. And I too welcome wealth. I want, when I leave the bath all\\nperfumed with essences, to feast bravely with my wife and children and to\\nbreak wind in the faces of toilers and Poverty.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. So that hussy has gone at last! But let us make haste to put\\nPlutus to bed in the Temple of Aesculapius.\\n\\nBLEPSIDEMUS. Let us make haste; else some bothering fellow may again come\\nto interrupt us.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Cario, bring the coverlets and all that I have got ready from\\nthe house; let us conduct the god to the Temple, taking care to observe\\nall the proper rites.\\n\\nCHORUS. [_Missing._][778]\\n\\nCARIO. Oh! you old fellows, who used to dip out the broth served to the\\npoor at the festival of Theseus with little pieces of bread[779] hollowed\\nlike a spoon, how worthy of envy is your fate! How happy you are, both\\nyou and all just men!\\n\\nCHORUS. My good fellow, what has happened to your friends? You seem the\\nbearer of good tidings.\\n\\nCARIO. What joy for my master and even more for Plutus! The god has\\nregained his sight; his eyes sparkle with the greatest brilliancy, thanks\\nto the benevolent care of Aesculapius.\\n\\nCHORUS. Oh! what transports of joy! oh! What shouts of gladness!\\n\\nCARIO. Aye! one is compelled to rejoice, whether one will or not.\\n\\nCHORUS. I will sing to the honour of Aesculapius, the son of illustrious\\nZeus, with a resounding voice; he is the beneficent star which men adore.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS\\' WIFE. What mean these shouts? Is there good news. With what\\nimpatience have I been waiting in the house, and for so long too!\\n\\nCARIO. Quick! quick! some wine, mistress. And drink yourself, for \\'tis\\nmuch to your taste; I bring you all blessings in a lump.\\n\\nWIFE. Where are they?\\n\\nCARIO. In my words, as you are going to see.\\n\\nWIFE. Have done with trifling! come, speak.\\n\\nCARIO. Listen, I am going to tell you everything from the feet to the\\nhead.\\n\\nWIFE. Ah! don\\'t throw anything at my head.\\n\\nCARIO. Not even the happiness that has come to you?\\n\\nWIFE. No, no, nothing ... to annoy me.\\n\\nCARIO. Having arrived near to the Temple with our patient, then so\\nunfortunate, but now at the apex of happiness, of blessedness, we first\\nled him down to the sea to purify him.\\n\\nWIFE. Ah! what a singular pleasure for an old man to bathe in the cold\\nsea-water!\\n\\nCARIO. Then we repaired to the Temple of the god. Once the wafers and the\\nvarious offerings had been consecrated upon the altar, and the cake of\\nwheaten-meal had been handed over to the devouring Hephaestus, we made\\nPlutus lie on a couch according to the rite, and each of us prepared\\nhimself a bed of leaves.\\n\\nWIFE. Had any other folk come to beseech the deity?\\n\\nCARIO. Yes. Firstly, Neoclides,[780] who is blind, but steals much better\\nthan those who see clearly; then many others attacked by complaints of\\nall kinds. The lights were put out and the priest enjoined us to sleep,\\nespecially recommending us to keep silent should we hear any noise. There\\nwe were all lying down quite quietly. I could not sleep; I was thinking\\nof a certain stew-pan full of pap placed close to an old woman and just\\nbehind her head. I had a furious longing to slip towards that side. But\\njust as I was lifting my head, I noticed the priest, who was sweeping off\\nboth the cakes and the figs on the sacred table; then he made the round\\nof the altars and sanctified the cakes that remained, by stowing them\\naway in a bag. I therefore resolved to follow such a pious example and\\nmade straight for the pap.\\n\\nWIFE. You wretch! and had you no fear of the god?\\n\\nCARIO. Aye, indeed! I feared that the god with his crown on his head\\nmight have been near the stew-pan before me. I said to myself, \"Like\\npriest, like god.\" On hearing the noise I made, the old woman put out her\\nhand, but I hissed and bit it, just as a sacred serpent might have\\ndone.[781] Quick she drew back her hand, slipped down into the bed with\\nher head beneath the coverlets and never moved again; only she let go\\nsome wind in her fear which stunk worse than a weasel. As for myself, I\\nswallowed a goodly portion of the pap and, having made a good feed, went\\nback to bed.\\n\\nWIFE. And did not the god come?\\n\\nCAIRO. He did not tarry; and when he was near us, oh! dear! such a good\\njoke happened. My belly was quite blown out, and I let wind with the\\nloudest of noises.\\n\\nWIFE. Doubtless the god pulled a wry face?\\n\\nCARIO. No, but Iaso blushed a little and Panacea[782] turned her head\\naway, holding her nose; for my perfume is not that of roses.\\n\\nWIFE. And what did the god do?\\n\\nCARIO. He paid not the slightest heed.\\n\\nWIFE. He must then be a pretty coarse kind of god?\\n\\nCARIO. I don\\'t say that, but he\\'s used to tasting shit.[783]\\n\\nWIFE. Impudent knave, go on with you!\\n\\nCARIO. Then I hid myself in my bed all a-tremble. Aesculapius did the\\nround of the patients and examined them all with great attention; then a\\nslave placed beside him a stone mortar, a pestle and a little box.[784]\\n\\nWIFE. Of stone?\\n\\nCARIO. No, not of stone.\\n\\nWIFE. But how could you see all this, you arch-rascal, when you say you\\nwere hiding all the time?\\n\\nCARIO. Why, great gods, through my cloak, for \\'tis not without holes! He\\nfirst prepared an ointment for Neoclides; he threw three heads of\\nTenian[785] garlic into the mortar, pounded them with an admixture of\\nfig-tree sap and lentisk, moistened the whole with Sphettian[786]\\nvinegar, and, turning back the patient\\'s eyelids, applied his salve to\\nthe interior of the eyes, so that the pain might be more excruciating.\\nNeoclides shrieked, howled, sprang towards the foot of his bed and wanted\\nto bolt, but the god laughed and said to him, \"Keep where you are with\\nyour salve; by doing this you will not go and perjure yourself before the\\nAssembly.\"\\n\\nWIFE. What a wise god and what a friend to our city!\\n\\nCARIO. Thereupon he came and seated himself at the head of Plutus\\' bed,\\ntook a perfectly clean rag and wiped his eye-lids; Panacea covered his\\nhead and face with a purple cloth, while the god whistled, and two\\nenormous snakes came rushing from the sanctuary.\\n\\nWIFE. Great gods!\\n\\nCARIO. They slipped gently beneath the purple cloth and, as far as I\\ncould judge, licked the patient\\'s eyelids; for, in less time than even\\nyou need, mistress, to drain down ten beakers of wine, Plutus rose up; he\\ncould see. I clapped my hands with joy and awoke my master, and the god\\nimmediately disappeared with the serpents into the sanctuary. As for\\nthose who were lying near Plutus, you can imagine that they embraced him\\ntenderly. Dawn broke and not one of them had closed an eye. As for\\nmyself, I did not cease thanking the god who had so quickly restored to\\nPlutus his sight and had made Neoclides blinder than ever.\\n\\nWIFE. Oh! thou great Aesculapius! How mighty is thy power! (_To Cario._)\\nBut tell me, where is Plutus now?\\n\\nCARIO. He is approaching, escorted by an immense crowd. The rich, whose\\nwealth is ill-gotten, are knitting their brows and shooting at him looks\\nof fierce hate, while the just folk, who led a wretched existence,\\nembrace him and grasp his hand in the transport of their joy; they follow\\nin his wake, their heads wreathed with garlands, laughing and blessing\\ntheir deliverer; the old men make the earth resound as they walk together\\nkeeping time. Come, all of you, all, down to the very least, dance, leap\\nand form yourselves into a chorus; no longer do you risk being told, when\\nyou go home, \"There is no meal in the bag.\"\\n\\nWIFE. And I, by Hecate! I will string you a garland of cakes for the good\\ntidings you have brought me.\\n\\nCARIO. Hurry, make haste then; our friends are close at hand.\\n\\nWIFE. I will go indoors to fetch some gifts of welcome, to celebrate\\nthese eyes that have just been opened.\\n\\nCARIO. Meantime I am going forth to meet them.\\n\\nCHORUS. [_Missing._]\\n\\nPLUTUS. I adore thee, oh! thou divine sun, and thee I greet thou city,\\nthe beloved of Pallas; be welcome, thou land of Cecrops, which hast\\nreceived me. Alas! what manner of men I associated with! I blush to think\\nof it. While, on the other hand, I shunned those who deserved my\\nfriendship; I knew neither the vices of the ones nor the virtues of the\\nothers. A twofold mistake, and in both cases equally fatal! Ah! what a\\nmisfortune was mine! But I want to change everything; and in future I\\nmean to prove to mankind that, if I gave to the wicked, \\'twas against my\\nwill.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS (_to the crowd who impede him_). Get you gone! Oh! what a lot\\nof friends spring into being when you are fortunate! They dig me with\\ntheir elbows and bruise my shins to prove their affection. Each one wants\\nto greet me. What a crowd of old fellows thronged round me on the\\nmarket-place!\\n\\nWIFE. Oh! thou, who art dearest of all to me, and thou too, be welcome!\\nAllow me, Plutus, to shower these gifts of welcome over you in due accord\\nwith custom.\\n\\nPLUTUS. No. This is the first house I enter after having regained my\\nsight; I shall take nothing from it, for \\'tis my place rather to give.\\n\\nWIFE. Do you refuse these gifts?\\n\\nPLUTUS. I will accept them at your fireside, as custom requires. Besides,\\nwe shall thus avoid a ridiculous scene; it is not meet that the poet\\nshould throw dried figs and dainties to the spectators; \\'tis a vulgar\\ntrick to make \\'em laugh.\\n\\nWIFE. You are right. Look! yonder\\'s Dexinicus, who was already getting to\\nhis feet to catch the figs as they flew past him.[787]\\n\\nCHORUS. [_Missing_.]\\n\\nCARIO. How pleasant it is, friends, to live well, especially when it\\ncosts nothing! What a deluge of blessings flood our household, and that\\ntoo without our having wronged ever a soul! Ah! what a delightful thing\\nis wealth! The bin is full of white flour and the wine-jars run over with\\nfragrant liquor; all the chests are crammed with gold and silver, \\'tis a\\nsight to see; the tank is full of oil,[788] the phials with perfumes, and\\nthe garret with dried figs. Vinegar flasks, plates, stew-pots and all the\\nplatters are of brass; our rotten old wooden trenchers for the fish have\\nto-day become dishes of silver; the very night-commode is of ivory. We\\nothers, the slaves, we play at odd and even with gold pieces, and carry\\nluxury so far that we no longer wipe ourselves with stones, but use\\ngarlic stalks instead. My master, at this moment, is crowned with flowers\\nand sacrificing a pig, a goat and a ram;[789] \\'tis the smoke that has\\ndriven me out, for I could no longer endure it, it hurt my eyes so.\\n\\nA JUST MAN. Come, my child, come with me. Let us go and find the god.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Who comes here?\\n\\nJUST MAN. A man who was once wretched, but now is happy.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. A just man then?\\n\\nJUST MAN. You have it.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Well! what do you want?\\n\\nJUST MAN. I come to thank the god for all the blessings he has showered\\non me. My father had left me a fairly decent fortune, and I helped those\\nof my friends who were in want; \\'twas, to my thinking, the most useful\\nthing I could do with my fortune.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And you were quickly ruined?\\n\\nJUST MAN. Entirely.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Since then you have been living in misery?\\n\\nJUST MAN. In truth I have; I thought I could count, in case of need, upon\\nthe friends whose property I had helped, but they turned their backs upon\\nme and pretended not to see me.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. They laughed at you, \\'tis evident.\\n\\nJUST MAN. Just so. With my empty coffers, I had no more friends.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But your lot has changed.\\n\\nJUST MAN. Yes, and so I come to the god to make him the acts of gratitude\\nthat are his due.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But with what object now do you bring this old cloak, which\\nyour slave is carrying? Tell me.\\n\\nJUST MAN. I wish to dedicate it to the god.[790]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Were you initiated into the Great Mysteries in that\\ncloak?[791]\\n\\nJUST MAN. No, but I shivered in it for thirteen years.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And this footwear?\\n\\nJUST MAN. These also are my winter companions.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And you wish to dedicate them too?\\n\\nJUST MAN. Unquestionably.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Fine presents to offer to the god!\\n\\nAN INFORMER. Alas! alas! I am a lost man. Ah! thrice, four, five, twelve\\ntimes, or rather ten thousand times unhappy fate! Why, why must fortune\\ndeal me such rough blows?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Oh, Apollo, my tutelary! oh! ye favourable gods! what has\\novertaken this man?\\n\\nINFORMER. Ah! am I not deserving of pity? I have lost everything; this\\ncursed god has stripped me bare. Ah! if there be justice in heaven, he\\nshall be struck blind again.\\n\\nJUST MAN. Methinks I know what\\'s the matter. If this man is unfortunate,\\n\\'tis because he\\'s of little account and small honesty; and i\\' faith he\\nlooks it too.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Then, by Zeus! his plight is but just.\\n\\nINFORMER. He promised that if he recovered his sight, he would enrich us\\nall unaided; whereas he has ruined more than one.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But whom has he thus ill-used?\\n\\nINFORMER. Me.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You were doubtless a villainous thief then.\\n\\nINFORMER (_to Chremylus and Cario_). \\'Tis rather you yourselves who were\\nsuch wretches; I am certain you have got my money.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Ha! by Demeter! \\'tis an informer. What impudence!\\n\\nCARIO. He\\'s ravenously hungry, that\\'s certain.\\n\\nINFORMER. You shall follow me this very instant to the marketplace, where\\nthe torture of the wheel shall force the confession of your misdeeds from\\nyou.\\n\\nCARIO. Ha! look out for yourself!\\n\\nJUST MAN. By Zeus the Deliverer, what gratitude all Greeks owe to Plutus,\\nif he destroys these vile informers!\\n\\nINFORMER. You are laughing at me. Ho! ho! I denounce you as their\\naccomplice. Where did you steal that new cloak from? Yesterday I saw you\\nwith one utterly worn out.\\n\\nJUST MAN. I fear you not, thanks to this ring, for which I paid\\nEudemus[792] a drachma.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Ah! there\\'s no ring to preserve you from the informer\\'s bite.\\n\\nINFORMER. The insolent wretches! But, my fine jokers, you have not told\\nme what you are up to here. Nothing good, I\\'ll be bound.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Nothing of any good for you, be sure of that.\\n\\nINFORMER. By Zeus!  you\\'re going to dine at my expense!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You vile impostor, may you burst with an empty belly, both you\\nand your witness.\\n\\nINFORMER. You deny it? I reckon, you villians, that there is much salt\\nfish and roast meat in this house. Hu! hu! hu! hu! hu! hu! (_He sniffs._)\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Can you smell anything, rascal?\\n\\nINFORMER. Can such outrages be borne, oh, Zeus! Ye gods! how cruel it is\\nto see me treated thus, when I am such an honest fellow and such a good\\ncitizen!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You an honest man! you a good citizen!\\n\\nINFORMER. A better one than any.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Ah! well then, answer my questions.\\n\\nINFORMER. Concerning what?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Are you a husbandman?\\n\\nINFORMER. D\\'ye take me for a fool?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. A merchant?\\n\\nINFORMER. I assume the title, when it serves me.[793]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Do you ply any trade?\\n\\nINFORMER. No, most assuredly not!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Then how do you live, if you do nothing?\\n\\nINFORMER. I superintend public and private business.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You! And by what right, pray?\\n\\nINFORMER. Because it pleases me to do so.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Like a thief you sneak yourself in where you have no business.\\nYou are hated by all and you claim to be an honest man?\\n\\nINFORMER. What, you fool? I have not the right to dedicate myself\\nentirely to my country\\'s service?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Is the country served by vile intrigue?\\n\\nINFORMER. It is served by watching that the established law is\\nobserved--by allowing no one to violate it.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. That\\'s the duty of the tribunals; they are established to that\\nend.\\n\\nINFORMER. And who is the prosecutor before the dicasts?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Whoever wishes to be.[794]\\n\\nINFORMER. Well then, \\'tis I who choose to be prosecutor; and thus all\\npublic affairs fall within my province.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. I pity Athens for being in such vile clutches. But would you\\nnot prefer to live quietly and free from all care and anxiety?\\n\\nINFORMER. To do nothing is to live an animal\\'s life.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Thus you will not change your mode of life?\\n\\nINFORMER. No, though they gave me Plutus himself and the _silphium_ of\\nBattus.[795]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS (_to the Informer_). Come, quick, off with your cloak.\\n\\nCARIO. Hi! friend! \\'tis you they are speaking to.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Off with your shoes.\\n\\nCARIO. All this is addressed to you.\\n\\nINFORMER. Very well! let one of you come near me, if he dares.\\n\\nCARIO. I dare.\\n\\nINFORMER. Alas!  I am robbed of my clothes in full daylight.\\n\\nCARIO. That\\'s what comes of meddling with other folk\\'s business and\\nliving at their expense.\\n\\nINFORMER (_to his witness_). You see what is happening; I call you to\\nwitness.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Look how the witness whom you brought is taking to his heels.\\n\\nINFORMER. Great gods! I am all alone and they assault me.\\n\\nCARIO. Shout away!\\n\\nINFORMER. Oh! woe, woe is me!\\n\\nCARIO. Give me that old ragged cloak, that I may dress out the informer.\\n\\nJUST MAN. No, no; I have dedicated it to Plutus.\\n\\nCARIO. And where would your offering be better bestowed than on the\\nshoulders of a rascal and a thief? To Plutus fine, rich cloaks should be\\ngiven.\\n\\nJUST MAN. And what then shall be done with these shoes? Tell me.\\n\\nCARIO. I will nail them to his brow as gifts are nailed to the trunks of\\nthe wild olive.\\n\\nINFORMER. I\\'m off, for you are the strongest, I own. But if I find\\nsomeone to join me, let him be as weak as he will, I will summon this\\ngod, who thinks himself so strong, before the Court this very day, and\\ndenounce him as manifestly guilty of overturning the democracy by his\\nwill alone and without the consent of the Senate or the popular Assembly.\\n\\nJUST MAN. Now that you are rigged out from head to foot with my old\\nclothes, hasten to the bath and stand there in the front row to warm\\nyourself better; \\'tis the place I formerly had.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Ah! the bath-man would grip you by the testicles and fling you\\nthrough the door; he would only need to see you to appraise you at your\\ntrue value.... But let us go in, friend, that you may address your\\nthanksgivings to the god.\\n\\nCHORUS. [_Missing._]\\n\\nAN OLD WOMAN. Dear old men, am I near the house where the new god lives,\\nor have I missed the road?\\n\\nCHORUS. You are at his door, my pretty little maid, who question us so\\nsweetly.[796]\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Then I will summon someone in the house.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. \\'Tis needless! I am here myself. But what matter brings you\\nhere?\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Ah! a cruel, unjust fate! My dear friend, this god has made\\nlife unbearable to me through ceasing to be blind.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. What does this mean? Can you be a female informer?\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Most certainly not.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Have you not drunk up your money then?\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. You are mocking me! Nay! I am being devoured with a consuming\\nfire.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Then tell me what is consuming you so fiercely.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Listen! I loved a young man, who was poor, but so handsome, so\\nwell-built, so honest! He readily gave way to all I desired and acquitted\\nhimself so well! I, for my part, refused him nothing.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And what did he generally ask of you.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Very little; he bore himself towards me with astonishing\\ndiscretion! perchance twenty drachmae for a cloak or eight for footwear;\\nsometimes he begged me to buy tunics for his sisters or a little mantle\\nfor his mother; at times he needed four bushels of corn.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. \\'Twas very little, in truth; I admire his modesty.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. And \\'twas not as a reward for his complacency that he ever\\nasked me for anything, but as a matter of pure friendship; a cloak I had\\ngiven would remind him from whom he had got it.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. \\'Twas a fellow who loved you madly.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. But \\'tis no longer so, for the faithless wretch has sadly\\naltered! I had sent him this cake with the sweetmeats you see here on\\nthis dish and let him know that I would visit him in the evening....\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Well?\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. He sent me back my presents and added this tart to them, on\\ncondition that I never set foot in his house again. Besides, he sent me\\nthis message, \"Once upon a time the Milesians were brave.\"[797]\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. An honest lad, indeed! But what would you? When poor, he would\\ndevour anything; now he is rich, he no longer cares for lentils.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Formerly he came to me every day.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. To see if you were being buried?\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. No! he longed to hear the sound of my voice.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And to carry off some present.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. If I was downcast, he would call me his little duck or his\\nlittle dove in a most tender manner....\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And then would ask for the wherewithal to buy a pair of shoes.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. When I was at the Mysteries of Eleusis in a carriage,[798]\\nsomeone looked at me; he was so jealous that he beat me the whole of that\\nday.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. \\'Twas because he liked to feed alone.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. He told me I had very beautiful hands.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Aye, no doubt, when they handed him twenty drachmae.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. That my whole body breathed a sweet perfume.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Yes, like enough, if you poured him out Thasian wine.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. That my glance was gentle and charming.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. \\'Twas no fool. He knew how to drag drachmae from a hot-blooded\\nold woman.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Ah! the god has done very, very wrong, saying he would support\\nthe victims of injustice.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Well, what must he do? Speak, and it shall be done.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. \\'Tis right to compel him, whom I have loaded with benefits, to\\nrepay them in his turn; if not, he does not merit the least of the god\\'s\\nfavours.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And did he not do this every night?\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. He swore he would never leave me, as long as I lived.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Aye, rightly; but he thinks you are no longer alive.[799]\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Ah! friend, I am pining away with grief.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. You are rotting away, it seems to me.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. I have grown so thin, I could slip through a ring.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Yes, if \\'twere as large as the hoop of a sieve.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. But here is the youth, the cause of my complaint; he looks as\\nthough he were going to a festival.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Yes, if his chaplet and his torch are any guides.\\n\\nYOUTH. Greeting to you.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. What does he say?\\n\\nYOUTH. My ancient old dear, you have grown white very quickly, by heaven!\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Oh! what an insult!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. It is a long time, then, since he saw you?\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. A long time? My god! he was with me yesterday.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. It must be, then, that, unlike other people, he sees more\\nclearly when he\\'s drunk.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. No, but I have always known him for an insolent fellow.\\n\\nYOUTH. Oh! divine Posidon! Oh, ye gods of old age! what wrinkles she has\\non her face!\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Oh! oh! keep your distance with that torch.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Yes, \\'twould be as well; if a single spark were to reach her,\\nshe would catch alight like an old olive branch.\\n\\nYOUTH. I propose to have a game with you.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Where, naughty boy?\\n\\nYOUTH. Here. Take some nuts in your hand.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. What game is this?\\n\\nYOUTH. Let\\'s play at guessing how many teeth you have.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Ah! I\\'ll tell you; she\\'s got three, or perhaps four.\\n\\nYOUTH. Pay up; you\\'ve lost! she has only one single grinder.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. You wretch! you\\'re not in your right senses. Do you insult me\\nthus before this crowd?\\n\\nYOUTH. I am washing you thoroughly; \\'tis doing you a service.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. No, no! as she is there, she can still deceive; but if this\\nwhite-lead is washed off, her wrinkles would come out plainly.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. You are only an old fool!\\n\\nYOUTH. Ah! he is playing the gallant, he is fondling your breasts, and\\nthinks I do not see it.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Oh! no, by Aphrodité, no, you naughty jealous fellow.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Oh! most certainly not, by Hecaté![800] Verily and indeed I\\nwould need to be mad! But, young man, I cannot forgive you, if you cast\\noff this beautiful child.\\n\\nYOUTH. Why, I adore her.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. But nevertheless she accuses you ...\\n\\nYOUTH. Accuses me of what?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. ... of having told her insolently, \"Once upon a time the\\nMilesians were brave.\"\\n\\nYOUTH. Oh! I shall not dispute with you about her.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Why not?\\n\\nYOUTH. Out of respect for your age; with anyone but you, I should not be\\nso easy; come, take the girl and be happy.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. I see, I see; you don\\'t want her any more.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Nay! this is a thing that cannot be allowed.\\n\\nYOUTH. I cannot argue with a woman, who has been making love these\\nthirteen thousand years.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Yet, since you liked the wine, you should now consume the\\nlees.\\n\\nYOUTH. But these lees are quite rancid and fusty.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Pass them through a straining-cloth; they\\'ll clarify.\\n\\nYOUTH. But I want to go in with you to offer these chaplets to the god.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. And I too have something to tell him.\\n\\nYOUTH. Then I don\\'t enter.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Come, have no fear; she won\\'t harm you.\\n\\nYOUTH. \\'Tis true; I\\'ve been managing the old bark long enough.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Go in; I\\'ll follow after you.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Good gods! that old hag has fastened herself to her youth like\\na limpet to its rock.\\n\\nCHORUS. [_Missing._]\\n\\nCARIO (_opening the door_). Who knocks at the door? Halloa! I see no one;\\n\\'twas then by chance it gave forth that plaintive tone.\\n\\nHERMES (_to Carlo, who is about to close the door_). Cario! stop!\\n\\nCARIO. Eh! friend, was it you who knocked so loudly? Tell me.\\n\\nHERMES. No, I was going to knock and you forestalled me by opening. Come,\\ncall your master quick, then his wife and his children, then his slave\\nand his dog, then thyself and his pig.\\n\\nCARIO. And what\\'s it all about?\\n\\nHERMES. It\\'s about this, rascal! Zeus wants to serve you all with the\\nsame sauce and hurl the lot of you into the Barathrum.\\n\\nCARIO. Have a care for your tongue, you bearer of ill tidings! But why\\ndoes he want to treat us in that scurvy fashion?\\n\\nHERMES. Because you have committed the most dreadful crime. Since Plutus\\nhas recovered his sight, there is nothing for us other gods, neither\\nincense, nor laurels, nor cakes, nor victims, nor anything in the world.\\n\\nCARIO. And you will never be offered anything more; you governed us too\\nill.\\n\\nHERMES. I care nothing at all about the other gods, but \\'tis myself. I\\ntell you I am dying of hunger.\\n\\nCARIO. That\\'s reasoning like a wise fellow.\\n\\nHERMES. Formerly, from earliest dawn, I was offered all sorts of good\\nthings in the wine-shops,--wine-cakes, honey, dried figs, in short,\\ndishes worthy of Hermes. Now, I lie the livelong day on my back, with my\\nlegs in the air, famishing.\\n\\nCARIO. And quite right too, for you often had them punished who treated\\nyou so well.[801]\\n\\nHERMES. Ah! the lovely cake they used to knead for me on the fourth of\\nthe month![802]\\n\\nCARIO. You recall it vainly; your regrets are useless! there\\'ll be no\\nmore cake.\\n\\nHERMES. Ah! the ham I was wont to devour!\\n\\nCARIO. Well then! make use of your legs and hop on one leg upon the\\nwine-skin,[803] to while away the time.\\n\\nHERMES. Oh! the grilled entrails I used to swallow down!\\n\\nCARIO. Your own have got the colic, methinks.\\n\\nHERMES. Oh! the delicious tipple, half wine, half water!\\n\\nCARIO. Here, swallow that and be off. (_He discharges a fart._)\\n\\nHERMES. Would you do a friend a service?\\n\\nCARIO. Willingly, if I can.\\n\\nHERMES. Give me some well-baked bread and a big hunk of the victims they\\nare sacrificing in your house.\\n\\nCARIO. That would be stealing.\\n\\nHERMES. Do you forget, then, how I used to take care he knew nothing\\nabout it when you were stealing something from your master?\\n\\nCARIO. Because I used to share it with you, you rogue; some cake or other\\nalways came your way.\\n\\nHERMES. Which afterwards you ate up all by yourself.[804]\\n\\nCARIO. But then you did not share the blows when I was caught.\\n\\nHERMES. Forget past injuries, now you have taken Phylé.[805] Ah! how I\\nshould like to live with you! Take pity and receive me.\\n\\nCARIO. You would leave the gods to stop here?\\n\\nHERMES. One is much better off among you.\\n\\nCARIO. What! you would desert! Do you think that is honest?\\n\\nHERMES. \"Where I live well, there is my country.\"[806]\\n\\nCARIO. But how could we employ you here?\\n\\nHERMES. Place me near the door; I am the watchman god and would shift off\\nthe robbers.\\n\\nCARIO. Shift off! Ah! but we have no love for shifts.\\n\\nHERMES. Entrust me with business dealings.\\n\\nCARIO. But we are rich; why should we keep a haggling Hermes?\\n\\nHERMES. Let me intrigue for you.[807]\\n\\nCARIO. No, no, intrigues are forbidden; we believe in good faith.\\n\\nHERMES. I will work for you as a guide.\\n\\nCARIO. But the god sees clearly now, so we no longer want a guide.\\n\\nHERMES. Well then, I will preside over the games. Ah! what can you object\\nto in that? Nothing is fitter for Plutus than to give scenic and\\ngymnastic games.[808]\\n\\nCARIO. How useful \\'tis to have so many names! Here you have found the\\nmeans of earning your bread. I don\\'t wonder the jurymen so eagerly try to\\nget entered for many tribunals.[809]\\n\\nHERMES. So then, you admit me on these terms.\\n\\nCARIO. Go and wash the entrails of the victims at the well, so that you\\nmay show yourself serviceable at once.\\n\\nA PRIEST OF ZEUS. Can anyone direct me where Chremylus is?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. What would you with him, friend?\\n\\nPRIEST. Much ill. Since Plutus has recovered his sight, I am perishing of\\nstarvation; I, the priest of Zeus the Deliverer, have nothing to eat!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. And what is the cause of that, pray?\\n\\nPRIEST. No one dreams of offering sacrifices.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Why not?\\n\\nPRIEST. Because all men are rich. Ah! when they had nothing, the merchant\\nwho escaped from shipwreck, the accused who was acquitted, all immolated\\nvictims; another would sacrifice for the success of some wish and the\\npriest joined in at the feast; but now there is not the smallest victim,\\nnot one of the faithful in the temple, but thousands who come there to\\nease themselves.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Don\\'t you take your share of those offerings?\\n\\nPRIEST. Hence I think I too am going to say good-bye to Zeus the\\nDeliverer, and stop here myself.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Be at ease, all will go well, if it so please the god. Zeus\\nthe Deliverer[810] is here; he came of his own accord.\\n\\nPRIEST. Ha! that\\'s good news.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Wait a little; we are going to install Plutus presently in the\\nplace he formerly occupied behind the Temple of Athené;[811] there he\\nwill watch over our treasures for ever. But let lighted torches be\\nbrought; take these and walk in solemn procession in front of the god.\\n\\nPRIEST. That\\'s magnificent!\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Let Plutus be summoned.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. And I, what am I to do?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Take the pots of vegetables which we are going to offer to the\\ngod in honour of his installation and carry them on your head; you just\\nhappen luckily to be wearing a beautiful embroidered robe.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. And what about the object of my coming?\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Everything shall be according to your wish. The young man will\\nbe with you this evening.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN. Oh! if you promise me his visit, I will right willingly carry\\nthe pots.\\n\\nCHREMYLUS. Those are strange pots indeed! Generally the scum rises to the\\ntop of the pots, but here the pots are raised to the top of the old\\nwoman.[812]\\n\\nCHORUS. Let us withdraw without more tarrying, and follow the others,\\nsinging as we go.[813]\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFINIS OF \"PLUTUS\"']\n"
